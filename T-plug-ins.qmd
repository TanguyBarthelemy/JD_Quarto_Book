# Plug-ins (GUI extensions) {#t-plug-ins .unnumbered}

JDemetra+ Graphical User Interface can be extended with plug-ins, which are components adding specific features to the **main** software.

In this chapter, we cover

-   Algorithms available via plug-ins

-   [Utility plug-ins](#t-plug-ins-ut): data providers, data formatting

-   Installation [procedure](#t-plug-ins-inst) which consists of downloading the appropriate "\*.nbm" file and installation it with the GUI.

## Algorithms available with plug-ins {#t-plug-ins-algs}

Here is an overview of the algorithms which can be added by installing additional plug-ins to the Graphical User Interface. For all the mentioned files corresponding number of version is denoted x.y.z.

### Seasonal Adjustment of Low frequency data

For low frequency (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, quadri-monthly) data the following additional algorithms are available with plug-ins. Corresponding files are located in the [Incubator](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-incubator) ([latest releases](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-incubator/releases)). Installation of auxiliary plug-in "jdplus-advancedsa-desktop-plugin-x.y.z.nbm" also located in the incubator is required.

It currently supports versions 2000-2016 read/write and 97 read-only.Being a pure Java library, you don't need MS Access installed in order to read Access files.

## Installation procedure {#t-plug-ins-inst}

Installation from GUI

menu\>tools\> plug-ins

The *Plugins* window includes five panels: *Updates*, *Available plugins*, *Downloaded*, *Installed* and *Settings*, some of them however are not operational in the current version of the software.

-   The *Updates* panel offers the user the option to manually check if some updates of the already installed plugins are available. This functionality, however, is currently not operational for the JDemetra+ plugins.
-   The *Available plugins* panel allows the downloading of all plugins that are related to JDemetra+. This functionality, however, is currently not operational for the JDemetra+ plugins.
-   The *Downloaded* panel is designed for the installation of new plugins from a local machine. This process in explained in more detail below.
-   The *Settings* panel is designated for adding update centres, which are the locations that hold plugins. For each centre the user can specify proxy settings and a time interval to automatically check for any updates. At the moment this functionality is not operational for the JDemetra+ plugins.

Installation of the new plugins from the local machine can be done from the *Plugin* functionality activated from the *Tools* menu.

**The impact of the plugin on the interface**

The list of all installed plugins is displayed in the fourth panel. To modify the current settings mark the plugin (by clicking the checkbox in the *Select* column) and chose an action.

The following options are available:

-   **Activate** -- activates the marked plugin if it is currently inactive. The option is available for inactive plugins (see the picture below);

-   **Deactivate** -- deactivates the marked plugin if it is currently active. The option is available for active plugins (see the picture below);

-   **Uninstall** -- uninstalls the marked plugin.

Inactive plugins can be activated or uninstalled.

![](All_images/UG_A_image31.png)

**Active plugins can be deactivated or uninstalled**

![](All_images/UG_A_image32.png)

**List of plugins -- deactivation**

There is a wizard that allows the user to activate/deactivate/uninstall the marked plugin(s). The example below illustrates the deactivation process. In the first step the user is expected to confirm or cancel the deactivation.

![](All_images/UG_A_image33.png)

**Plugin's deactivation process**

In the second step the user should decide if the software will be restarted immediately after the uninstallation is completed or not.

![](All_images/UG_A_image34.png)

**The final step of the installation procedure**

It is possible to delay the restart of the application, although the restart is necessary to complete the process.
