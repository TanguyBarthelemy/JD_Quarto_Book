# Methods {.unnumbered #part-M}

This part provides underlying methodological background on all the algorithms featured in JDemetra+. 

Practical guidance on how to use these algorithms can be found [here](#part-A), whereas detailed description of all the available tools allowing to use them can be found in the [Tools](#part-T) part of this book.

-   [Tests for seasonality and residuals](M-tests.qmd)

-   [Reg-Arima modelling](#m-reg-a)

-   [X-11: moving average based decomposition](#m-X11)

-   [Seats: Arima model based decomposition](#m-seats)
