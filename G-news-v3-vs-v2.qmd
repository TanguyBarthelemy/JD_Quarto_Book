# New Features in v 3.x family {.unnumbered #v3-vs-v2}


## In this chapter

This chapter provides an overview of the new features in version 3.x  as well as significant modification of display or content for features already available in v 2.2.4. Compared to its predecessor, version 3.x provides:

-   Additional Algorithms for Seasonal Adjustment (SA), Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation (TD), Nowcasting, Revision Analysis

-   More stand alone time series tools

-   More "acceptable" frequencies in SA

-   New SA (mass) production possibilities

## Seasonal Adjustment and Modelling

### Seasonal adjustment algorithms {#v3-vs-v2-sa}

#### Improvements on historical algorithms

Improvements X-13-Arima and Tramo-Seats (historical JD+)

-   New acceptable data frequencies for seasonal adjustment and modelling of low frequency data:

        - In v3.x Low frequency data: $p$ in ${2,3,4,6,12}$ is admissible in all
        algorithms (historical and new)
        
        - In version 2, only Tramo-Seats supported all these frequencies, whereas
        X13-Arima was restricted to $p$ in ${2,4,12}$

-   outlier correction taken into account when
    selecting decomposition scheme

-   ex-ante leap year correction added to Tramo-Seats (like in X13)

-   automatic trading day regressors selection from pre-defined sets built, according to groups of days

-   specification: split into two distinct concepts, which can be
    directly manipulated by the user:

    -   reference (or domain) specification: a global set of constraints
        inside of which estimation will be performed
    
    -   point (or estimation) specification: contains all parameter choices resulting from estimation 

The user can transform a given "estimation specification" in a user defined specification.

#### New algorithms in v3.x

Tramo-Seats and X-13-Arima share a very similar and sophisticated
pre-adjustment process for the Arima model selection phase.

For new algorithms, the philosophy is to offer

-   a simplified pre-adjustment on the arima modelling side, reduced to
    airline model

-   several enhanced decomposition options

    -   stl+ ("+" stands for airline based pre-adjustment)

    -   x12+: airline based pre-adjustment + new trend estimation
        filters (Local Polynomials)

    -   seats+ (to come in the target v3 version): airline based
        pre-adjustment + AMB decomposition

#### SA with Basic Structural Models (BSM) available in GUI

In version 3.x, SA with Basic Structural Models is a fully integrated
process with outlier detection, calendar correction and options on
external regressors.

Fundamentally it is a one-step estimation, performing pre-adjustment and
decomposition (with explicit components) in the same run

This makes regression variable selection more complicated:

-   first step: a variable selection is performed with a Tramo like
    airline model regression

-   second: the entire structural model is estimated

In version 3.x this process is available from the graphical user interface.

#### SA algorithms extended for high-frequency data

All algorithms are available via an R package and will be available in GUI (in target v 3.x version)

-   Extended Airline estimation, reg-Arima like (`rjd3highfreq` and GUI )

-   Extended Airline Decomposition, Seats like (`rjd3highfreq` and GUI )

-   MX12+ (`rjd3x11plus`, GUI upcoming)

-   MSTL+ (`rjd3stl` and in GUI)

-   MSTS (`rjd3sts`, GUI upcoming)

## New SA (mass) production possibilities

<!-- (provide links) -->

### New R Tools for wrangling workspaces

With functions for 

- changing raw data path

- customizing specifications 

- merging workspaces by series names, as you would do with a data table

These functions are in `rjd3providers` and  `rjd3workspace` packages, (already in a v 2.x stable precursor `rjdworkspace`)


### Production fully in R

without a workspace structure 

- TS objects and full flexibility for customizing specifications

- new R functions enabling to apply revision policies (`rjd3x13::refresh` and `rjd3tramoseats::refresh`), with even more flexibility on data spans

Inherent shortcoming: data no readable by GUI, depriving of more sophisticated and visual feedback (compared to R) for manual fine tuning.

Solution : new R functions to create GUI readable dynamic workspaces on the fly (in aforementioned packages).

In the target 3.x, additional algorithms (X12+, STL+, BSM) will also be usable in production with a workspace and cruncher (on low frequency data)

## Time series general purpose tools

Version 3.x offers more stand alone tools (mainly in `rjd3toolkit`)

-   Tests (seasonality, auto-correlation, normality, randomness...)

-   (Fast) Arima Modelling 

-   Flexible Calendar regressors generation

-   Auxiliary variables for pre-adjustment

-   Spectral analysis (in GUI)

-   Detection of multiple seasonal patterns (Canova-Hansen test)

-   State space frame work as a toolbox (`rjd3sts`)

### Canova-Hansen test to identify multiple seasonal patterns

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
rjd3toolkit::seasonality_canovahansen(
    data = df_daily$births, 
    p0 = min(ch.sp), 
    p1 = max(ch.sp), 
    np = max(ch.sp) - min(ch.sp) + 1
)
```

## Underway developments

-   Moving Trading Days module integrated in all SA algorithms (for low and high frequency data), with two implementations one based on rolling windows and one on state        space modelling

-   Using Cubic Splines for smoother seasonal factors estimation of long periodicities ($p=365,25$)
