# GUI: Generating output {.unnumbered #t-gui-output}

## In this chapter

This chapter describes how to generate (export) output (series, parameters, diagnostics) directly from the Graphical User interface:
<!-- (independent from a special routine SA, Bench...) -->

<!-- We will cover:  -->

<!-- - Seasonal Adjustment (SA-Processing) -->
<!-- - Modelling (up coming content) -->
<!-- - Benchmarking (up coming content) -->

When running a SA-processing in GUI, series, parameters, diagnostics can be also generated without opening it, using a production module called [the cruncher](#t-prod).

Additional chapters related to GUI features, provide information on:

- [Overview](#t-gui-overview)
- [Data visualization and generic time series tools](#t-GUI-tstools)
- [Specific Seasonal Adjustement and Modelling features](#t-gui-sa)

## Output from SA Processing

### Steps

1.  Once a seasonal adjustment process for the dataset is performed Go to the TOP menu bar and follow the path: *SAProcessing* â†’ *Output...*

    ![**Default output formats**](All_images/SAProcessing_output.png)
    
2.  In the *Batch output* window the user can specify which output items will be saved and the folder in which JDemetra+ saves the results. It is possible to save the results in the `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xls`, and `.csv` matrix formats. In the first step the user should choose the output format from the list.

    ![**Default output formats in v3**](All_images/UDimage6.jpg)
    
    ![**Default output formats in v2**](All_images/output_format_v2.png)
    
3.  The user may choose more than one format as the output can be generated in different formats at the same time.

4.  To display and modify the settings click on the given output format on the list. The available options depend on the output format.

### The different ouput formats

::: {.panel-tabset .content-visible when-format="html"}

#### `.csv`

For `.csv` format the following options are available: 

- *folder* (location of the file), 
- *file prefix* (name of the file),
- *presentation* (controls how the output is divided into separate files)
- and *series* (series included in the file). 

These options are presented in the next points of this case study.

![**Options for a `.csv` format**](All_images/UDimage8.jpg)


The user can define the folder in which the selected results and components will be saved (click the *folder* item and choose the final destination).

![**Specifying a destination folder**](All_images/UDimage9.jpg)

With the option *File Prefix* the user can modify the default name of the output saved in the `.csv` file.

![**Setting a *File Prefix* option**](All_images/UDimage10.jpg)

*Presentation* controls how the output is divided into separate files. Expand the list to display available options:

- *HTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of horizontal tables (time series in rows).
- *VTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of vertical tables (time series in columns).
- *List* -- the output series will be presented in the form of vertical tables (time series in rows). Apart from that, for each time series each file contains in separate columns: the data frequency, the first year and stimation span, the first period (month or quarter) of observation span and the number of observations. The files do not include dates.

![**Layout options for a `.csv` format**](All_images/UDimage11.jpg)

The option *Full series name* is used to use the fully qualified name of the series (workbook + sheet + name) in the output.

![**The *Full series name* option**](All_images/output_csv_full_names.png)

![**The generated output**](All_images/generated_output_csv_full_names.png)

The *Content* section presents a list of series that will be included into a set of output files. To modify the initial settings click on the grey button in the *Content* section. The *CVS-series* window presents two panels:

- the panel on the left includes a list of all valuable output items
- the panel on the right presents the selected output items

Mark the series and use the arrows to change the settings. Confirm your choice with the *OK* button.

![**Specifying a content of the output file**](All_images/output_csv_content.png)


#### `.csv` matrix

The `.csv` matrix produces the `.csv` file containing information about the model and quality diagnostics of the seasonal adjustment. The user may generate the list of default items or create their own quality report. 


![**Options for a `.csv` matrix format**](All_images/output_csv_matrix.png)


The user can define the folder in which the selected results and components will be saved (click the *folder* item and choose the final destination).

![**Specifying a destination folder**](All_images/output_csv_matrix_folder.png)

With the option *File Name* the user can modify the default name of the output saved in the `.csv` file.

![**Setting a *File Name* option**](All_images/output_csv_matrix_name.png)


By default, all the available items are included in the output. 

![**List of items available for the `.csv` matrix output type**](All_images/UDimage18.png)


Once the output settings are selected, click the *OK* button.

![**Validation of the `.csv` matrix output**](All_images/UDimage19.png)


#### *Excel*

Options available for the `.xls` format are the same as for the `.txt` format with an exception of the *Layout* section. 

- *BySeries* -- all results for a given time series are placed in one sheet;
- *ByComponent* -- results are grouped by components. Each component type is saved in a separate sheet;
- *OneSheet* -- all results are saved in one sheet.

![**Layout options for an *Excel* format**](All_images/UDimage13.jpg)

If the user sets the option layout to *BySeries*, the output will be generated as follows:

- Series are placed in separate sheets
- Components are placed in different columns

![**An Excel file view for the *BySeries* option**](All_images/output_excel_by_series.png)

If the user sets the option layout to *ByComponent*, the output will be generated as follows:

- Components are placed in separate sheets
- Series are placed in different columns

![**An Excel file view for the *ByComponent* option**](All_images/UDimage14.jpg)

The option *OneSheet* will produce the following `.xls` file:

- Components and Sheets are crossed in different columns of the same sheet

![**An Excel file view for the *OneSheet* option**](All_images/UDimage15.jpg)

By default, the series in the Excel output files are organised vertically. When the user unmarks the check box the horizontal orientation is used.

![**The *VerticalOrientation* option**](All_images/UDimage16.jpg)

The option *Full series name* is used to use the fully qualified name of the series (workbook + sheet + name).

![**The *Full series name* option**](All_images/output_excel_full_names.png)

This option will produce the following `.xls` file:

![**The generated output**](All_images/generated_output_excel_full_names.png)

The *Content* section presents a list of series that will be included into a set of output files. To modify the initial settings click on the grey button in the *Content* section. The *Excel-series* window presents two panels: 

- the panel on the left includes a list of all valuable output items
- the panel on the right presents the selected output items

Mark the series and use the arrows to change the settings. Confirm your choice with the *OK* button.

![**Specifying a content of the output file**](All_images/UDimage12.jpg)

#### `.txt` (only in v2)

In the case of the `.txt` format the only available options are *folder* (location of the file) and *series* (results included in the output file).

![**Options for the `.txt` output**](All_images/UDimage17.jpg)


#### *CvsArray* (only in v3)



:::


For each output JDemetra+ provides information on the status of the operation. An example is presented below.
