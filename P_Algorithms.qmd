# Algorithms {.unnumbered #part-A}

This part provides practical guidance for using all the algorithms featured in JDemetra+, be it with the [Graphical User Interface](#t-gui-overview) or [R packages](#t-r-packs)

Further methodological insights on each algorithm can be found in the [Methods](#part-M) part of this book, whereas detailed description of all the available tools allowing to access the algorithms can be found in the [Tools](#part-T) part.

JDemetra+ provides algorithms in the following domains:
