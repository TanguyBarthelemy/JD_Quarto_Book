# Graphical User Interface

## Overview

why use the graphical user interface ? what is not directly available in
R yet?

obj here: make parts shorter and steps more obvious SA will be detailed
as the most used (the common pars just linked )

### Old intro to edit

This document aims to introduce users to the main features of JDemetra+
enabling them to take advantage of this program and understand the
output from the sequential steps in the analysis. The document includes
step-by-step descriptions of how to perform a typical analysis and
useful tips that facilitate replication of the results with the user's
own data and working instructions. The *Case Studies* section does not
cover all available JDemetra+ functionalities. These are included in the
[Reference Manual](../reference-manual/) and the user should refer to it
for additional information.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts, such as *time
series*, *trend-cycle*, *seasonality*, *descriptive statistics*,
*confidence levels*, *mean square error*, *estimate*, *estimator*,
*linear regression, stationarity*, *ARIMA process* and so on. Readers
with insufficient background to follow this document are encouraged to
refer to an appropriate textbook, e.g. Chatfield (2004).

JDemetra+ uses the notation "X12", "X13","Arima", "RegArima" and
"TramoSeats" instead of "X-12-ARIMA", "X-13ARIMA-SEATS", "ARIMA",
"RegARIMA" and "TRAMO-SEATS" respectively. This notation is also used in
the *Case Studies* when references to the user interface are made.

### Who should use this document? {#who-should-use-this-document}

With JDemetra+, which is an extremely user-friendly software,
pre-adjustment and decomposition of a time series can be performed
easily by users who have absolutely no knowledge of seasonal adjustment
theory. Although the output is easy to produce, its analysis,
interpretation, readjustment and validation requires certain knowledge
and experience. Therefore the *JDemetra+ User Guide* is designed for two
types of users: beginners, who have only a basic knowledge of
seasonality and its estimation in time series, and advanced users, who
already perform seasonal adjustment and are able to interpret the
outcomes, at least at a basic level.

*Case Studies* section neither describes in detail how the seasonal
adjustment methods work, nor the underlying mathematics. For readers
interested in seasonal adjustment methods a brief sketch of the
X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO-SEATS algorithms and concepts are included in
the [Reference Manual](../reference-manual/). For those interested in a
more detailed discussion of seasonal adjustment you are encouraged to
refer to the [References](../references) section.

## Installation Procedure

JDemetra+ is a stand-alone application packed in a zip package. To run
JDemetra+ the Java RE 8 or higher is needed. Java RE can be downloaded
from [Oracle
website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

The official release of JDemetra+ is accessible at [a dedicated GitHub
page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases). The site
presents all available releases - both official releases (labelled in
green as latest releases) and pre-releases (labelled in red) - packed in
zip packages. From the *Latest release* section either choose the
installer appropriate for your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS,
Solaris) or take the portable zip-file. The installation process is
straightforward and intuitive. For example, when the zip-file is chosen
and downloaded, then under Windows OS the application can be found in
the "bin"-folder of the installation/unpacked zip. To open an
application, double click on nbdemetra.exe or nbdemetra64.exe depending
on the system version (nbdemetra.exe for the 32-bit system version and
nbdemetra64.exe for the 64-bit system version).

![Text](All_images/RunningJDemetra.jpg)

**Launching JDemetra+**

If the launching of JDemetra+ fails, you can try the following
operations:

-   Check if Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) is properly installed by
    typing in the following command in a terminal: *java --version*

-   Check the logs in your home directory:

    -   %appdata%/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/ for Windows;

    -   \~/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/ for Linux and Solaris;

    -   \~/Library/Application Support/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/ for Mac
        OS X.

In order to remove a previously installed JDemetra+ version, the user
should delete an appropriate JDemetra+ folder.

### Running JDemetra+ {#running-jdemetra}

To open an application, navigate to the destination folder and double
click on *nbdemetra.exe* or *nbdemetra64.exe* depending on the system
version (*nbdemetra.exe* for the 32-bit system version and
*nbdemetra64.exe* for the 64-bit system version).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref1.jpg)

**Running JDemetra+**

### Closing JDemetra+ {#closing-jdemetra}

To close the application, select *File â†’ Exit* from the [File
menu](http://localhost:4000/pages/reference-manual/file.html).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref2.jpg)

**Closing JDemetra+**

The other way is to click on the close box in the upper right-hand
corner of the JDemetra+ window. If there is any unsaved work, JDemetra+
will display a warning and provide the user with the opportunity to save
it. The message box is shown below.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref3.jpg)

## Global structure

here menus and functions common to all the algos

### Interface Starting Winwow

The default view of the JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after
launching the program, is shown below.

![Text](All_images/Jd+mainwindow.jpg)

**JDemetra+ default window**

By default, on the left hand side of the window two panels are visible:
the [*Workspace* panel](../reference-manual/workspace.html) and the
[*Providers* panel](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). The
*Workspace* panel stores the work performed by the user in a coherent
and structured way. The *Providers* panel presents the list of the [data
sources](../quick-start/datasources.html) and organizes the imported
series within each data provider. By default, JDemetra+ supports the
following data sources: \* JDBC; \* ODBC; \* SDMX; \* Excel
spreadsheets; \* TSW (input files for the [Tramo-Seats-Windows
application](https://www.bde.es/bde/en/secciones/servicios/Profesionales/Programas_estadi/Programas.html)
by the Bank of Spain); \* TXT; \* USCB (input files for the
[X-13-ARIMA-SEATS application](https://www.census.gov/srd/www/winx13/)
by the U.S. Census Bureau); \* XML.

All standard databases (Oracle, SQLServer, DB2, MySQL) are supported by
JDemetra+ via JDBC, which is a generic interface to many relational
databases. Other providers can be added by users by creating plugins. We
will now focus on the Spreadsheets data source, which corresponds to the
series prepared in an Excel file. The file should have dates in Excel
date format. Dates should be placed in the first column (or in the first
row) and titles of the series in the corresponding cell of the first row
(or in the first column). The top-left cell [A1] can include text or it
can be left empty. The empty cells are interpreted by JDemetra+ as
missing values and they can appear at the beginning, in the middle and
at the end of the time series. The example is shown below.

![Text](All_images/Spreadsheet.jpg)

**Example of an Excel spreadsheet that can be imported to JDemetra+**

Once the spreadsheet is prepared and saved, it can be imported to
JDemetra+ as it is shown by the tutorial below.

![Alt](All_images/Import_spreadsheet.gif)

**An example of importing process for the Excel file**

The default JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the
program, is clearly divided into several panels.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d28.jpg)

**JDemetra+ default view**

The key parts of the user interface are: \* The [application
menu](#application-menu). \* The [Providers](data-providers.html)
window, which organises time series; \* The [Workspace](workspace.html)
window, which stores results generated by the software as well as
settings used to create them; \* A central empty zone for presenting the
actual analyses further called the [Results](#results-panel) panel.

### Application menu {#application-menu}

The majority of functionalities are available from the main application
menu, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If the user
moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the left
mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in the
drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref10.jpg)

**The main menu with selected drop-down menu**

The functions available in the main application menu are: \*
[File](file.html) \* [Statistical methods](Statistical-methods.html) \*
[X-13Doc](x-13doc.html) \* [RegArimaDoc](regarimadoc.html) \*
[TramoDoc](tramodoc.html) \* [TramoSeatsDoc](tramoseatsdoc.html) \*
[View](view.html) \* [Tools](tools.html) \* [Window](window.html) \*
[Help](help.html)

### Results panel {#results-panel}

The blank zone in the figure above (on the right of the view) is the
location where JDemetra+ displays various windows. More than one window
can be displayed at the same time. Windows can overlap with each other
with the foremost window being the one in focus or active. The active
window has a darkened title bar. [The windows in the results panel can
be arranged in many different ways](../reference-manual/window.html),
depending on the user's needs. The example below shows one of the
possible views of this panel. The results of the user's analysis are
displayed in an accompanying window. The picture below shows two panels
-- a window containing seasonal adjustment results (upper panel) and
another one containing an autoregressive spectrum (lower panel).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref9.jpg)

**The *Results* panel filled with two windows**

### Menus

#### File Menu

The *File* menu is intended for working with
[workspaces](workspace.html) and [data
sources](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). It offers the
following functions:\
\* **New Workspace** -- creates a new workspace and displays it in the
*Workspace* window with a default name (*Workspace\_#number*); \* **Open
Workspace** -- opens a dialog window, which enables the user to select
and open an existing workspace; \* **Open Recent Workspace** -- presents
a list of workspaces recently created by the user and enables the user
to open one of them; \* **Save Workspace** -- saves the project file
named by the system under the default name (*Workspace\_#number*) and in
a default location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later time; \*
**Save Workspace As...** -- saves the current workspace under the name
chosen by the user in the chosen location. The workspace can be
re-opened at a later time; \* **Open Recent** -- presents a list of
datasets recently used and enables the user to open one of them; \*
**Exit** -- closes an application.

![Text](All_images/File%20menu.jpg)

**The content of the *File* menu**

#### View Menu

The View menu contains functionalities that enable the user to modify
how JDemetra+ is viewed. It offers the following items: \* **Split** --
the function is not operational in the current version of the software.
\* **Toolbars** -- displays selected toolbars under the main menu. The
*File* toolbar contains the *Save all* icon. The *Performance* toolbar
includes two icons: one to show the performance of the application, the
other to stop the application profiling and taking a snapshot. The
*Other* toolbar determines the default behaviour of the program when the
user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot the data,
visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified action, e.g.
execute a seasonal adjustment procedure. \* **Show Only Editor** --
displays only the *Results* panel and hides other windows (e.g.
*Workspace* and *Providers*). \* **Full Screen** -- displays the current
JDemetra+ view in full screen.

![Text](All_images/View%20menu.jpg)

**The *View* menu**

#### Window menu

The *Window* menu offers several functions that facilitate the analysis
of data and enables the user to adjust the interface view to the user's
needs.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref51.jpg)

**The *Window* menu**

-   **Preview Time Series** -- opens a window that plots any of the
    series the user selects from *Providers*.

-   **Debug** -- opens a *Preview Time Series* window that enables a
    fast display of the graphs for time series from a large dataset. To
    display the graph click on the series in the *Providers* window.

-   [**Providers**](../reference-manual/data-providers.html) -- opens
    (if closed) and activates the *Providers* window.

-   [**Variables**](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html) --
    opens (if closed) and activates the *Variable* window.

-   [**Workspace**](../reference-manual/workspace.html) -- opens (if
    closed) and activates the *Workspace* window.

-   **Output** -- a generic window to display outputs in the form of
    text; useful with certain plug-ins (e.g. tutorial descriptive
    statistics).

-   **Editor** -- activates the editor panel (and update the main menu
    consequently).

-   **Configure Window** -- enables the user to change the way that the
    window is displayed (maximise, float, float group, minimise,
    minimise group). This option is active when some window is displayed
    in the JD+ interface.

-   **Properties** -- opens the *Properties* window and displays the
    properties of the marked item (e.g. time series, data source).

-   **Reset Windows** -- restores the default JDemetra+ view.

-   **Close Window** -- closes all windows that are open.

-   **Close All Documents** -- closes all documents that are open.

-   **Close Other Documents** -- closes all documents that are open
    except for the one that is active (which is the last activated one).

-   **Document Groups** -- enables the user to create and manage the
    document groups.

-   **Documents** -- lists all documents that are active.

#### Workspace Menu

Workspace is a JDemetra+ functionality that stores the work performed by
the user in a coherent and structured way. By default, each workspace
contains the pre-defined modelling and seasonal adjustment
specifications and a basic calendar. A specification is a set of
modelling and/or seasonal adjustment parameters. Within the workspace
the following items can be saved: \* [User-defined modelling
specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html#user-definedSpec)
and [seasonal adjustment
specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html); \*
Documents that contain [results from time series
modelling](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html) and [output from
the seasonal adjustment process](../reference-manual/output.html); \*
[User-defined calendars](../reference-manual/calendars.html); \*
[User-defined regression
variables](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html).

Together with the results from modelling and seasonal adjustment, the
original data, paths to the input files and parameters of processes are
all saved. These results can then be re-opened, updated, investigated
and modified in further JDemetra+ sessions.

The workspace saved by JDemetra+ includes: \* Main folder containing
several folders that correspond to the different types of items created
by the user and; \* The xml file that enables the user to import the
workspace to the application and to display its content.

An example of the workspace is shown in the figure below.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref7.jpg)

**A workspace saved on PC**

The workspace can be shared with other users, which eases the burden of
work with defining specifications, modelling and seasonal adjustment
processes.

The content of the workspace is presented in the *Workspace* window. It
is divided into three sections: \*
[Modelling](../reference-manual/modelling.html) (contains the default
and user-defined specifications for modelling; and the output from the
modelling process) \* [Seasonal adjustment](../reference-manual/sa.html)
(contains the default and user-defined specifications for seasonal
adjustment and the output from the seasonal adjustment process), \*
Utilities ([calendars](calendars.html) and [user defined
variables](user-defined-variables.html)).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref8.jpg)

**The *Workspace* window**

#### Statistical Methods Menu

The Statistical methods menu includes functionalities for modelling,
analysis and the seasonal adjustment of a time series. They are divided
into three groups: \* [Anomaly Detection](#anomaly-detection) -- allows
for a purely automatic identification of regression effects; \*
[Modelling](#modelling) -- enables time series modelling using the TRAMO
and RegARIMA models; \* [Seasonal adjustment](#seasonal-adjustment) --
intended for the seasonal adjustment of a time series with the
TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods.

![Text](All_images/Statistical%20methods%20menu.jpg)

**The *Statistical methods* menu.**

### Anomaly Detection {#anomaly-detection}

The primary goal of the functionalities that are available in the
*Anomaly Detection* section is the identification of atypical values
called outliers. According to the ['*ESS Guidelines on Seasonal
Adjustment*'](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3)
(2015), seasonal adjustment methods are likely to be severely affected
by the presence of such values; therefore they should be detected and
replaced simultaneously or before estimating the seasonal and calendar
components in order to avoid a distorted or biased estimation.

The use of the RegARIMA models is recommended by the '*ESS Guidelines on
Seasonal Adjustment*' (2015) to estimate and remove outliers before
estimating the seasonal effect. As the presence of outliers could
greatly affect the quality of the decomposition, the various types of
outlier (i.e. additive outliers, transitory changes, level shifts, etc.)
should be detected and corrected for.

This element of quality control should be performed each time new or
revised data become available. Manual inspection of the data is
problematic, especially in the case of large datasets. Also, it usually
relies on some simple measures, which do not consider the full
information contained in the series, but just a few values. Therefore
the results of the manual inspection can be severaly affected by
seasonality, noise, or special events.

JDemetra+ includes two tools dedicated to the automatic identification
of outliers: *Check Last* and *Outliers Detection*. Both are based on
the TERROR program, which is an application from TRAMO. TERROR is
executed by both tools to automatically (with several available options)
detect outliers.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref13.jpg)

**The *Anomaly detection* menu.**

#### Check Last {#check-last}

The *Check Last* tool automatically detects using the TRAMO model
forecasts up to three last observations and marks the observations that
are too different from their forecasted values. The *Check Last* *Batch*
window is divided into three panels. The panel on the left presents the
list of the analysed series. The results are dispalyed in the panels on
the right.

To launch the analysis, drag and drop a series from the *Providers*
window into the left hand side panel of the *Check Last Batch* window
and click the *Start* button (denoted with the green arrow) from the
menu in the top part of the window. The analysis will be performed using
the TRAMO specification selected from the list. By default, TR4 is used.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref14.jpg)

**The *Check Last* initial window with series to be processed and the
list of available specifications expanded.**

JDemetra+ removes the last observations from the series and calculates a
one-period-ahead out-of-sample forecast of the series. The forercasted
values are then compared with the actual values. The user may decide how
many of the last observations will be considered (one, two, or three) in
this procedure (click on the **123** button and specify the number). The
number of columns visible in the panel on the left will be adjusted
accordingly to the user's choice.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref15.jpg)

**The options for number of observations to be examined.**

The default settings can be changed in the *Properties* dialog box (the
number of last observations that will be compared to the forecasted
values, specification used for modelling and the threshold values used
to decide if observations are abnormal). To open it, click on the button
marked with the working tools.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref16.jpg)

**The properties for the *Check Last* functionality.**

Once the process is executed, click on the series on the list to display
the results. For each series the program automatically identifies an
ARIMA model, detects several types of outliers, interpolates missing
values and estimates the calendar effects, if appropriate. Study the
detailed results section using the vertical scrollbar.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref17.jpg)

**The results of the outlier's detection process.**

The last observations (one, two or three, depending of the user's
choice) are compared with the forecasted values. If, for a given
observation, the forecast error divided by a standard deviation of
residuals is greater than the first threshold value and lower than the
second threshold value, then this observation is classified as
containing a "possible error" and marked in orange. If this value is
greater than the second threshold value, then the new observation is
classified as containing a "likely error" and marked in red. Otherwise,
the observation is accepted as "without an
error"[^graphical-user-interface-1].

[^graphical-user-interface-1]: Description of the idea of benchmarking
    is based on Dagum, B.E., Cholette, P.A. 1994), and Quenneville, B.
    et all (2003). Detailed information can be found in: Dagum, B.E.,
    Cholette, P.A. (2006).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref18.jpg)

**Investigation of the outliers' detection results.**

JDemetra+ enables the user to save the results of this analysis in the
compact form of a report. To generate it, click on the **Generate
Report** button and specify the sorting options.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref19.jpg)

**The *Generate Report* functionality.**

To save the report click **OK** and select a destination folder.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref20.jpg)

**Report from the outliers' detection process.**

#### Outlier detection {#outlier-detection}

The *Outlier Detection* tool allows for the identification of an ARIMA
model, including the detection of outliers, interpolation of missing
values and the estimation of any calendar effects. A step-by-step
demonstration of the *Outlier Detection* tool capabilities and options
can be found [here](../case-studies/modelling-basic.html).

### Modelling {#modelling}

add :

The aim of the *Modelling* section is to provide tools for time series
modelling and forecasting without performing the estimation of its
components and decomposition. The estimated results can be useful for
time series analysis and in the prediction of short-term developments.

The *Modelling* section includes all capabilities from the TRAMO and
RegARIMA models. It is flexible in [specifying model
parameters](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html). The
results can be saved and refreshed with updated series. Instructions on
how to use this functionality is given in [the step-by-step
demonstration on advanced time series
analysis](../case-studies/modelling-advanced.html).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref21.jpg)

**The *Modelling* menu.**

### Seasonal Adjustment {#seasonal-adjustment}

The *Seasonal Adjustment* section provides tools to perform seasonal
adjustment for a single time series as well as for multiple time series
using the TRAMO-SEATS or X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods. It also offers several
seasonality tests that can be used to scrutinize the presence and the
nature of seasonal movements in a time series independently from the
seasonal adjustment. Finally, the *Direct-Indirect Seasonal Adjustment*
tool enables a comparison of the results from direct and indirect
seasonal adjustment performed on the aggregated series.

The guidance for using these functionalities is given in the [Case
studies](../case-studies) section: - [basic scenario detailing the use
of automatic modelling in seasonal
adjustment](../case-studies/simplesa.html); - [different types of user
interventions](../case-studies/detailedsa.html); - [*Seasonality
Tests*](../case-studies/seasonalitytests.html); - [*Direct-Indirect
Seasonal Adjustment*](../case-studies/detailedsa-direct.html).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref22.jpg)

**The *Seasonal Adjustment* menu.**

### Importing data : the *providers* window

The *Providers* window presents the list of the data sources and
organises the imported series within each data provider.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref5.jpg)

**The *Providers* window**

The allowed data sources include: \* JDBC; \* ODBC; \* SDMX; \*
Spreadsheets; \* TSW; \* TXT; \* USCB; \* XML.

All standard databases (Oracle, SQLServer, DB2, MySQL) are supported by
JDemetra+ via JDBC, which is a generic interface to many relational
databases. Other providers can be added by users by creating plugins
(see *Plugins* section in the [Tools](tools.html) menu). To import data,
right-click on the appropriate provider from the *Providers* panel and
specify the required parameters. For all providers the procedure follows
the same logic. An example is provided [here](#import-data).

The *Providers* window organises data in a tree structure reflecting the
manner in which data are presented in the original source. The picture
below presents how JDemetra+ visualises the imported spreadsheet file.
If the user expands all the pluses under the spreadsheet all the series
within each sheet that has been loaded are visible. Here two time series
are visible: *Japan* (under the *Asia* branch) and *United States*
(under the *North America* branch) while the *Europe* branch is still
folded. The names of the time series have been taken from the column
headings of the spreadsheet while the names of the branches come from
sheets' names.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref6.jpg)

**A structure of a dataset**

Series uploaded to the *Providers* window can be
[displayed](../reference-manual/data-visualization.html), modified and
[tested for seasonality](../case-studies/seasonalitytests.html) and used
in estimation routines (see [Modelling](modelling.html) and [Seasonal
adjustment](sa.html)). The data sources can be restored after
re-starting the application so that there is no need to get them again.
This functionality can be set in the *Behaviour* tab available at the
[*Option*](../reference-manual/tools.html#options) item from the
[*Tools*](../reference-manual/tools.html) menu.

#### Spreadsheets {#spreadsheets}

The Spreadsheets data source corresponds to the series prepared in the
Excel file. The file should have true dates in the first column (or in
the first row) and titles of the series in the corresponding cell of the
first row (or in the first column). The top-left cell $$A1$$ can include
a text or it can be left empty. The empty cells are interpreted by
JDemetra+ as missing values and they can appear in the beginning, in the
middle and in the end of time series.

An example is presented below:

![Text](All_images/Aimage5.jpg)

**Example of an Excel spreadsheet that can be imported to JDemetra+**

Time series are identified by their names. JDemetra+ derives some
information (like data periodicity, starting and ending period) directly
from the first column (or from the first row, depending on the chosen
data orientation (vertical or horizontal)).

#### Import data {#import-data}

To import data from a given data source, click on this data source in
the *Providers* window shown below, choose *Open* option and specify the
import details, such as a path to a data file. These details vary
according to data providers. The example below show how to import the
data from an Excel file.

1.  From the *Providers* window right-click on the *Spreadsheets* branch
    and choose *Open* option.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage6.jpeg)

    **Data provider available by default**

2.  The *Open data source* window contains the following options:

    -   **Spreadsheet file** -- a path to access the Excel file.

    -   **Data format** -- the data format used to read dates and
        values. It includes three fields: *locale* (country), *date
        pattern* (data format, e.g. *yyyy-mm-dd*), *number pattern* (a
        metaformat of numeric value, e.g. 0.## represents two digit
        number).

    -   **Frequency** -- time series frequency. This can be undefined,
        yearly, half-yearly, four-monthly, quarterly, bi-monthly, or
        monthly. When the frequency is set to undefined, JDemetra+
        determines the time series frequency by analysing the sequence
        of dates in the file.

    -   **Aggregation type** -- the type of aggregation (over time for
        each time series in the dataset) for the imported time series.
        This can be *None*, *Sum*, *Average*, *First*, *Last*, *Min* or
        *Max*. The aggregation can be performed only if the *frequency*
        parameter is specified. For example, when frequency is set to
        *Quarterly* and aggregation type is set to *Average*, a monthly
        time series is transformed to quarterly one with values that are
        equal to the one third of the sum of the monthly values that
        belong to the corresponding calendar quarter.

    -   **Clean missing** -- erases the missing values of the series.

    Next, in the *Source* section click the grey "...." button (see
    below) to open the file.

    **Data source window**

3.  Choose a file and click *OK*.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage8.jpeg)

    **Choice of an Excel spreadsheet**

4.  The user may specify *Data format*, *Frequency* and *Aggregation
    type*, however this step is not compulsory. When these options are
    specified JDemetra+ is able to convert the time series frequency.
    Otherwise, the functionality that enables the time series frequency
    to be converted will not be available.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage9.jpeg)

    **Options for importing data**

5.  The data are organized in a tree structure.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage10.jpeg)

    **Dataset structure**

    Once the data has been successfully imported, it is available to the
    user for various analyses (e.g. visualization, modelling, seasonal
    adjustment, etc.)

The data are organized in a tree structure. If you expand all the plus-signs under the spreadsheet you will see all the series within each sheet that has been loaded. Here all time series are visible under the Production in construction branch. The names of time series have been taken from the columnsâ€™ headings of the spreadsheet while the names of the branches come from sheetsâ€™ names.

## An automatic run
To execute a seasonal adjustment process of given time series dataset go to the main menu and follow the path: Statistical methods â†’ Seasonal adjustment â†’ Multi Processing â†’ New. This command opens an empty SAProcessing window. Next, drag and drop series in the SAProcessing window and launch the seasonal adjustment process. Explore the results and save them. The gif below shows the detailes of the actions required for the seasonal adjustment process.

![Alt Text](All_images/FirstSAprocess.gif)

## Manual interventions
The specifications used for seasonal adjustment of an individual series can be changed as shown in the presentation below. Be aware that the changes introduced in a given settings' section may lead to changes in the output for other parts of the results.

![Alt Text](All_images/First-SA-process-specifcation.gif)

## Output options
To export the results of seasonal adjustment for the whole dataset, select the Output item from the SAProcessing menu.The results can be exported to CSV, CVS matrix, TXT and XLS formats and the list of available items depends on the format choice. The CVS, TXT and XLS formats are used to save the results in a form of the time series. The list is available [here](https://github.com/Immurb/TestWiki/wiki/The-output-items-for-the-CSV,-TXT-and-XLS-formats). The CVS martix is a format for saving various diagnostics and statistics.

### Charts

#### Data visualization

1.  To display a given series, right click on it and choose the *Chart &
    grid* option from the local menu. The graph is displayed in the
    panel on the right.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage11.jpeg)

    **Time series graph**

2.  Using the local menu that is available for the chart the user may
    adjust the view of the picture, save it and/or save it in a given
    location.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage12.jpeg)

    **Local menu basic options for the time series graph**

3.  Once the time series is marked by clicking on it with the left mouse
    button, more sophisticated options are available, in addition to the
    standard ones shown above.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage13.jpeg)

    **Full local menu options**

4.  These additional options include the *Open with* option, which opens
    time series in a separate window according to the user choice (chart
    & grid or only chart). *All ts views* option is not available at the
    moment. The picture below shows the view displayed once *Chart &
    grid* option was chosen. By clicking on the marked buttons the user
    can switch between chart and grid view. For both views (chart and
    grid) the local menu is available.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage14.jpeg)

    ***Chart & grid*** **view**

5.  *Rename* option (see below) enables the user to change the time
    series name.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage15.jpeg)

    **Renaming a time series**

6.  The option *Split into the yearly components* opens an additional
    window that presents the analysed series data split by year. This
    chart is useful to investigate the differences in time series values
    caused by the seasonal factors. The graph gives some idea about the
    existence and size of deterministic and stochastic seasonality in
    data.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage16.jpeg)

    ***Split into the yearly components*** **option's result**

7.  To display more than one series on the graph, select *Tools* â†’
    *Container* â†’ *Chart* from the main menu. Next, drag a drop series
    to the *Chart* window.

#### Charts for spectral Analysis

![Text](All_images/image3_342.jpeg)

**Auto-regressive spectrum's properties**

1.  The spectral graphs are available from: *Tools* â†’ *Spectral
    analysis.*

    ![Text](All_images/image1_342.jpeg)

    **Tools for spectral analysis**

2.  When the first option is chosen JDemetra+ displays an empty
    *Auto-regressive spectrum* window. To start an analysis drag a
    single time series from the *Providers* window and drop it into the
    *Drop data here* area.

    ![Text](All_images/image2_342.jpeg)

    **Launching an auto-regressive spectrum**

3.  An auto-regressive spectrum graph available in JDemetra+ is based on
    the relevant tool from the X-13ARIMA-SEATS program. It shows the
    spectral density (spectrum) function, which reformulates the content
    of the stationary time series' autocovariances in terms of
    amplitudes at frequencies of half a cycle per month or less. The
    number of observations, data transformations and other options such
    as the specification of the frequency grid and the order of the
    autoregressive polynomial (30 by default) can be specified by
    opening the *Window* â†’ *Properties* from the main menu.

    The *Auto-regressive - Properties* window contains the following
    options:

    -   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series;

    -   **Differencing** - transforms a data by calculating a regular
        (order 1,2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time
        series frequency) differences;

    -   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that the program will
        use to take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3*
        then the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag
        (default) but to the third lag.

    -   **Last years** - a number of years at the end of the time series
        taken to produce autoregresive spectrum. By default, it is 0,
        which means that the whole time series is considered.

    -   **Auto-regressive polynomial order** - the number of lags in the
        AR model that is used to estimate the spectral density. By
        default, the order of the autoregressive polynomial is set to 30
        lags.

    -   **Resolution** - the value 1 plots the spectral density estimate
        for the frequencies $\omega_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}$, where
        $n \in ( - \pi;\pi)$ is the size of the sample used to estimate
        the AR model. Increasing this value, which is set to 5 by
        default, will increase the precision of this grid.

4.  The seasonality test described above uses an empirical criterion to
    check whether the series has a seasonal component that is
    predictable (stable) enough that it can be estimated with reasonable
    success. The peak in the [auto-regressive
    spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html) has to be greater than the
    median of the 61 spectrum ordinates and has to exceed the two
    adjacent spectral values by more than a critical value. When such a
    case is detected, the test results are displayed in green.

    ![Text](All_images/image4_342.jpeg)

    **An example of an-auto-regressive spectrum**

5.  The second spectral graph is a periodogram. To perform the analysis
    of a single time series using this tool, choose *Tools* â†’*Spectral
    analysis* â†’ *Periodogram* and drag and drop a series from the
    *Providers* window to the empty *Periodogram* window.

    ![Text](All_images/image5_342.jpeg)

    **Launching a periodogram**

6.  The sample size and data transformations can be specified by opening
    the *Window* â†’ *Properties*, in the main menu. The *Periodogram -
    Properties* window contains the following options:

    -   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series;

    -   **Differencing** - transforms the data by calculating regular
        (order 1,2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time
        series frequency) differences;

    -   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that you will use to
        take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then
        the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag
        (default) but to the third lag.

    -   **Last years** - the number of years at the end of the time
        series taken to produce periodogram. By default it is 0, which
        means that the whole time series is considered.

    ![Text](All_images/image6_342.jpeg)

    **Periodogram's properties**

7.  The [periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html) was one of
    the earliest tools used for the analysis of time series in the
    frequency domain. It enables the user to identify the dominant
    periods (or frequencies) of a time series. In general, the
    periodogram is a wildly fluctuating estimate of the spectrum with a
    high variance and is less stable than an auto-regressive spectrum.

    ![Text](All_images/image7_342.jpeg)

    **An example of a periodogram**

8.  The third spectral graph is the Tukey spectrum. To perform the
    analysis of time series using this tool, choose *Tools* â†’ *Spectral
    analysis* â†’ *Tukey spectrum* and drag and drop a single series from
    the *Providers* window to the empty *Periodogram* window*.*

    ![Text](All_images//image8_342.jpeg)

    **Launching a Tukey spectrum**

9.  The Tukey spectrum estimates the spectral density by smoothing the
    periodogram.

    ![Text](All_images/image9_342.jpeg)

    **An example of a Tukey spectrum**

10. The options for the Tuckey window can be specified by opening the
    *Window* â†’ *Properties* from the main menu. The *Periodogram -
    Properties* window contains the following options:

    -   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series.

    -   **Differencing** - transforms the data by calculating regular
        (order 1, 2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time
        series frequency) differences.

    -   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that you will use to
        take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then
        the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag
        (default) but to the third lag.

    -   **Taper part** -- parameter larger than 0 and smaller or equal
        to one that shapes the curvature of the smoothing function that
        is applied to the auto-covariance function.

    -   **Window length** -- the size of the window that is used to
        smooth the auto-covariance function. A value of zero includes
        the whole series.

    -   **Window type** -- it refers to the weighting scheme that it is
        used to smooth the auto-covariance function. The available
        windows types (*Square*, *Welch*, *Tukey*, *Barlett*, *Hamming*,
        *Parzen*) are suitable to estimate the spectral density.

#### Quick demonstration

For a detailed demonstration of the seasonal adjustment process, please
refer to the [JDemetra+
Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYDyEqMSjZ8&t=) video
developed by Andreea Mirica (Statistics Romania). For a step-by-step
illustration of the key stages for seasonal adjustment, refer to the
guidance below.

The default view of the JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after
launching the program, is shown below.

![Text](All_images/Jd+mainwindow.jpg)

**JDemetra+ default window**

By default, on the left hand side of the window two panels are visible:
the [*Workspace* panel](../reference-manual/workspace.html) and the
[*Providers* panel](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). The
*Workspace* panel stores the work performed by the user in a coherent
and structured way. The *Providers* panel presents the list of the [data
sources](../quick-start/datasources.html) and organizes the imported
series within each data provider.

##### Importing the series

Once the spreadsheet is prepared as it is shown
[here](../quick-start/datasources.html) and saved, it can be imported to
JDemetra+ as it is shown in the video below.

![Text](All_images/Import_spreadsheet.gif)

**Importing the series**

The data are organized in a tree structure. If you expand all the
plus-signs under the spreadsheet you will see all the series within each
sheet that has been loaded. Here all time series are visible under the
*Production in construction* branch. The names of time series have been
taken from the columns' headings of the spreadsheet while the names of
the branches come from sheets' names.

## An automatic seasonal adjustment

To execute a seasonal adjustment process of given time series dataset go
to the main menu and follow the path: **Statistical methods â†’ Seasonal
adjustment â†’ Multi Processing â†’ New**. This command opens an empty
*SAProcessing* window. Next, drag and drop series in the *SAProcessing*
window and launch the seasonal adjustment process. Explore the results
and save them. The gif below shows the details of the actions performed
in an automatic seasonal adjustment process.

![Text](All_images/FirstSAprocess.gif)

**An example of an automatic seasonal adjustment process**

##### Manual interventions

The specifications used for seasonal adjustment of an individual series
can be changed as shown in the presentation below. Be aware that the
changes introduced in a given settings' section may lead to changes in
the output for other parts of the results. The options for the
pre-processing of the series are explained under [modelling
specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html) and
the options for the pure seasonal adjustment process are explained under
[seasonal adjustment
specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html).

![Text](All_images/First-SA-process-specifcation.gif)

**An example of manual interventions to the seasonal adjustment
process**

##### Output options

To export the results of seasonal adjustment for the whole dataset,
select the *Output* item from the *SAProcessing* menu.

![Text](All_images/output.jpg)

**The *SAProcessing* menu**

The procedure to extract the output is explained
[here](../case-studies/output.html) in detail. The results can be
exported to CSV, CVS matrix, TXT and XLS formats and the list of
available items depends on the format choice. The CVS, TXT and XLS
formats are used to save the results in a form of the time series. The
CVS matrix is a format for saving various diagnostics and statistics.
The list of available items is available [here](../theory/output.html).

### Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series

This scenario guides the user through all the steps of the process
required to seasonally adjust a single time series. Links to the
appropriate parts of the [*Reference
Manual*](../pages/reference-manual/) for detailed explanations are
provided when necessary.

1.  Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* â†’
    *Seasonal adjustment* â†’ *Single analysis*. Select a seasonal
    adjustment method (*TramoSeats* (i.e. the TRAMO-SEATS method will be
    used) or *X13* (i.e. the X13ARIMA-SEATS will be used).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image1.jpg)

    **Launching seasonal adjustment for a single time series**

2.  An empty panel will be opened. The picture below shows the view when
    the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method is chosen.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image2.jpg)

    **Single analysis window**

3.  Select a data provider and unfold an already imported dataset. Drag
    and drop one time series from the *Providers* window to the *Drop
    data here* box as shown below. The window contains two panels. The
    one on the left presents the structure of the output in the form of
    an output tree. The other one is empty. Once the seasonal adjustment
    has been performed, this panel will show detailed results for any
    item chosen by the user from the output tree.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image3.jpg)

    **Starting a seasonal adjustment process**

4.  When the user drops a series into the document window (X13Doc in the
    example presented in this scenario) JDemetra+ starts the seasonal
    adjustment process automatically. By default, a summary of results
    is displayed. It is accompanied by two graphs: an overlay graph on
    the left with the original unadjusted series, the
    seasonally-adjusted series and the trend-cycle and the *SI ratio*
    graph on the right. The diagnostics and graphs for the modelling
    part are discussed
    [here](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html). The user can find
    also find some explanations of the [results of seasonal adjustment
    for X-13ARIMA-SEATS](../reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html) and for
    [TRAMO-SEATS](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html)). The *Main
    results* panel provides a quick summary of the quality of the
    adjustment. Study the diagnostics section using the vertical
    scrollbar.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image4.jpg)

    **Simple seasonal adjustment, single time series: main results
    panel**

5.  The results are highlighted in green, yellow or red, depending on
    the result of the statistical test used. Green indicates that
    problematic characteristics have not been detected (e.g. lack of
    normality of residuals, autocorrelation in residuals). Yellow
    indicates that the test outcome is uncertain. Those in red indicate
    that there are issues that should be addressed. The user is expected
    to investigate the problematic test statistics and try to improve
    the model, so that no uncertain or rejected test results are
    present.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image5.jpg)

    **Diagnostic results - simple seasonal adjustment of single time

    **Specification panel**

9.  To change a given setting, click on it and choose an option from the
    list and/or enter a value. In the picture below the series span was
    shortened by the first 12 observations. Inputs in green indicate
    that the entered values are acceptable (appropriate format, data
    within the allowed range and so on). To apply the changes click on
    the *Apply* button in the bottom part of the window.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image9.jpg)

    **Modifying settings**

10. Be aware that the changes introduced may lead to changes in the
    output for other parts of the results. The example below illustrates
    that omitting the first 12 observations results in automatic
    detection of trading day effects and the Easter effect, which were
    not present in the previous model.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image10.jpg)

    **The effect of applying modified settings**

11. To copy the estimated series (seasonally adjusted, trend, seasonal
    and irregular) to another file go to the *Table* item in the *Main
    results* section of the output tree. Then click on the upper-left
    cell in the table.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image11.jpg)

    **Highlighting the output series**

14. To save the document created in JDemetra+ (named *X13Doc-1* in our
    example) select *Save Workspace As...* item from the *File* menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image14.jpg)

    **Saving a workspace**

15. Enter the location, workspace name and click *Save.*

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image15.jpg)

    **Choosing a destination folder**

16. The document is visible in the *Workspace* window under the
    appropriate section (*x13* in the case presented in the picture).
    The document can be opened, deleted or renamed from the context
    menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image16.jpg)

    **The content of the context menu for a single document**

17. The user can also add comments to the document. To display the
    comments and modify them, click on *Edit comments* from the context
    menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image17.jpg)

    **An example of an *Edit comments* window**

18. At the end of this process, the user is presented with the results
    already saved in the workspace. The option *Refresh data* becomes
    active when the given workspace is opened again. This option can be
    activated either from a local menu or from the main menu. Once it is
    activated, JDemetra+ refers to the data source defined in the
    workspace and uses this current version of data to perform seasonal
    adjustment with the settings saved in the document.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image18.jpg)

    **Refreshing the data**

### Specifications, documents, multi-documents

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d2.jpg)

\*\*The *Workspace* window with the nodes for the seasonal adjustment
procedure marked

Seasonal adjustment can be performed with pre-defined or user-defined
specifications. In general, these specifications include also a
modelling part, which is descibed under the [Modelling
section](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html).
Specifications are sets of parameters and values assigned to them that
contain all information necessary for seasonal adjustment. The
specifications for seasonal adjustment can be used for processing of a
single time series as well as a large dataset. The default critical
values used by the tests included in the specifications can be changed
by the user in the [*Tools* \\(\rightarrow\\) *Options*
menu](../reference-manual/tools.html#options).

#### Pre-defined specifications

The *Seasonal adjustment* section of the *Workspace* window contains a
set of pre-defined specifications that enables the user to seasonally
adjust the time series using two methods: TRAMO-SEATS and
X-13ARIMA-SEATS.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic19.jpg)

**A set of pre-defined seasonal adjustment specifications**

The set of pre-defined specifications for seasonal adjustment
encompasses the most commonly used sets of seasonal adjustment
parameters. The names of these pre-defined specifications correspond to
the terminology used in TSW+. The users are strongly recommended to
start their analysis with one of those specifications (usually *RSA4c*
or *RSA5c* for X-13ARIMA-SEATS and *RSA4*, *RSA5* or *RSAfull* for
TRAMO-SEATS). The user is expected to adjust the specification to the
specific needs the using the [*Specification*
button](../case-studies/modelling-advanced.html). The default
specification for TRAMO-SEATS and multi-documents is *RSAfull*, while
for X-13ARIMA-SEATS it is RSA4c.

**Explanations for settings:**

-   **Transformation test** -- a test is performed to choose between an
    additive decomposition (no transformation) and a multiplicative
    decomposition (logarithmic transformation).

-   **Pre-adjustment for leap-year** -- a correction of the February
    values, which is applied to the original series before the
    logarithmic transformation. The original values in February are
    multiplied by \\(\frac{28.25}{29}\\) for leap years and by
    \\(\frac{28.25}{28}\\) for non-leap years. Values for other months
    are not modified.

-   **Working days** -- a pre-test is made for a presence of a working
    day effect.

-   **Trading days** -- a pre-test is made for a presence of a trading
    day effect.

-   **Easter** -- a pre-test for a presence of the Easter effect. The
    default length of the Easter effect is 6 days (for TRAMO-SEATS
    specifications) and 8 days (for X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications).

-   **Outliers** -- an automatic identification of three types of
    outliers: AO (additive outliers), LS (level shifts) and TC
    (transitory changes), using a default critical value.

-   **ARIMA model** -- the choice between fixing the ARIMA model
    structure to (0,1,1)(0,1,1) or searching for the ARIMA model using
    an automatic model identification procedure (AMI). The
    (0,1,1)(0,1,1) model (called the Airline model) is used as a default
    model in several TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications
    because it has been shown in many studies that this model is
    appropriate for many real seasonal monthly or a quarterly time
    series. Moreover, the Airline model approximates well many other
    models and provides an excellent "benchmark"
    model[^graphical-user-interface-2].

#### User-defined specifications

The user may add new seasonal adjustment specifications to the
*Workspace* window. To do it, go to the *Seasonal adjustment* section,
right click on the *tramoseats* or *x13* item in the *specifications*
node and select *New* from the local menu.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic20.jpg)

**Creating a new specification in the *Seasonal adjustment* section**

Next, double click on the newly created specification, change the
settings accordingly and confirm with the **OK** button.

**Changing settings of seasonal adjustment specification**

### Defining and modifying a specification

In general, the user can choose the parameters of the seasonal
adjustment process by creating a specification with given settings or by
changing some settings in the specification currently in use.

1.  To create a new specification go to the *Workspace* window and
    choose a node, to which you wish to add a specification (*Modelling*
    or *Seasonal adjustment*). Then choose a method (*tramo* or
    *regarima* for *Modelling*, *tramoseats* or *x13* for *Seasonal
    adjustment*). Click on the left mouse button and choose a *New*
    option. The user can also import the specification from the external
    file with the *Import from* option.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image1.jpg)

    **Creating a new specification**

2.  Next, unfold the node (the *tramoseats* node in the case presented
    here) and right click on the newly created specification
    (*TramoSeatsSpec-1* in the case presented below) to open the local
    menu. The local menu offers the following options:

    -   **Open** -- displays the specification's settings

    -   **Export to** -- enables the user to save the specification in a
        config file.

    -   **Delete** -- removes the specification from the workspace.

    -   **Rename** -- enables the user to change the name of the
        user-defined specification.

    -   **Edit comments** -- a functionality for monitoring how a
        seasonal adjustment process is implemented. The user can add and
        modify short notes concerning a given time series. These notes
        are visible in the *Comments* column in the *Processing* window.
        The notes are displayed when the user hovers the mouse on the
        given cell.

    -   **Create document** -- adds a new document to the relevant place
        in the *Seasonal adjustment â†’ documents* section and assigns the
        specification selected by the user to it.

    -   **Clone** -- creates the copy of the specification and adds it
        to the list.

    Chose **Open** from the menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image2.jpg)

    **Opening a new specification**

3.  The *Specification* window is divided into several sections. The
    actual content depends on the choice made by the user in step 1 of
    this scenario. To introduce changes unfold the sections, modify the
    current settings (choose from the list or insert the value by hand)
    and confirm the changes with the *OK* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image3.jpg)

    **Modifying a new specification**

4.  User-defined specifications are usually used for seasonal adjustment
    of many time series (*Statistical methods* â†’ *Seasonal adjustment* â†’
    *Multi Processing* â†’ *New*). The user can also make changes to the
    specification after the modelling/seasonal adjustment process. In
    such a case, to introduce changes click on the *Specification*
    button. JDemetra+ opens the *Specifications* panel on the right.
    Unfold the sections, modify the current settings (choose from the
    list or type a new value) and confirm the changes with the *Apply*
    button. JDemetra+ automatically applies the new settings and
    displays the outcome resulting from the modified specification.

### Tramo-seats specification setting

This section discusses the options available for the TRAMO-SEATS
specifications, which are based on the original program developed by
Agustin Maravall and Victor GÃ³mez. It is divided into five parts that
correspond to the TRAMO-SEATS specification sections and are presented
in the order in which they are displayed in the graphical interface of
JDemetra+.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic22.jpg)

**A list of the TRAMO-SEATS specification's sections**

To avoid unnecessary repetitions, click on the respective link for a
description of the following sections of the TRAMO/SEATS specification:

-   [*Estimate*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#estimate);
-   [*Transformation*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#transformation);
-   [*Regression*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression);
-   [*Outliers*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#outliers);
-   [*Arima*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#arima).

This section focuses on the decomposition part of the seasonal
adjustment process and the options for benchmarking.

To facilitate the comparison between JDemetra+ specifications and
specifications used in TSW+, under each option the name of the
corresponding parameter from the original software is given, if any. For
an exact description of the different parameters originating from TSW+,
the user should refer to the documentation of TSW+. For each parameter
the default parameter value, which is displayed for a template created
in the *Workspace* window, is reported.

For the pre-defined specifications the items are fixed, while in the
case of the user-defined specifications the user can set them
individually. However, in some cases the choice of a given value results
in a limitation of the possible alternatives for other parameters.
Therefore, the user is not entirely free to set the parameters values.


### Creating a document

(better to create a multi-document : change approach)

The results of the seasonal adjustment process
resulting from the TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods is presented in the *Documents* section,
which belongs to the *Seasonal Adjustment* node.
These documents are displayed in the *TramoSeatsDoc* windows (for a time
series adjusted with TRAMO-SEATS), the *RegArimaSeatsDoc* window (for a
time series adjusted with X-13ARIMA-SEATS) and the *SAProcessing* window
(for a set of series adjusted with one or both methods).

There are several ways to create this document. One of them is to choose
the relevant option from the main application menu. For an analysis of a
single time series select *Statistical methods* â†’ *Seasonal Adjustment*
â†’ *Seasonal adjustment* â†’ *Single analysis*â†’ *TramoSeats/X13* and follow
[this scenario](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html).


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic24.jpg)



**Launching a seasonal adjustment for a single time series**

With his option a default specification will be assigned to the new
document (*TRfull* when *TramoSeats* is chosen, *RSA5c* when *X13* is
chosen). It means that a default specification will be used for a
seasonal adjustment of the series inserted into the documentâ€™s window.

For an analysis of a time series dataset select *Statistical methods* â†’
*Seasonal Adjustment* â†’ *Seasonal adjustment* â†’ *Multiprocessing* â†’
*New* and follow [this scenario](../case-studies/simplesa-muliple.html).


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic25.jpg)



**Activating a document for a single time series**

Alternatively, the document can be created directly in the *Workspace*
window. First, expand the *Seasonal adjustment â†’ specifications*. Then,
right click on the selected specification name under *tramoseats* or
*x13* nodes then chose the option *Create document*. An empty document
will be added to the relevant place in the *Seasonal adjustment â†’
documents* section and the specification selected by the user will be
assigned to it.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic26.jpg)



**Opening a new document from the *Seasonal adjustment â†’ specifications* level**

An empty document can also be created from the *Seasonal adjustment* â†’
*documents* level. It can be done by selecting one of the items
*tramoseats,* *x13* or *multi-documents* and choosing an option *New*
from the local menu (right click).


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic27.jpg)



**Creating a new document in the *Documents* section**

It is also possible to create a new document by choosing an option *New*
from the local menu, which is available for the *multi-documents* item
in the *Workspace\_\#number* tree.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic28.jpg)



**Creating a new document in the *Seasonal adjustment* section**

All documents are added to the relevant part of the *Workspace* window.
Once [the workspace is saved](../reference-manual/file.html) all the documents defined for this
workspace are saved as well. The user may then investigate the saved
results of the seasonal adjustment and update the documents created for a adjustment of a single time series with TRAMO-SEATS [see **Refresh data** option for the *TramoSeatsDoc* menu](../reference-manual/tramoseatsdoc.html),
with X-13ARIMA-SEATS [see **Refresh data** option for the *X13Doc* menu](../reference-manual/x-13doc.html) and [the documents for a dataset](../case-studies/revision.html). 


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic29.jpg)



**Location of the documents for modelling with the RegARIMA model**

To use the documents created directly in the *Workspace* window, double
click on its name to display it. To perform an analysis, drag and drop
the series from the *Workspace* window to the document window
(*SAProcessing-\#number*, *TramoSeatsDoc-\#number* or
*X13Doc-\#number*).


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic30.jpg)



**Choosing a time series for the seasonal adjustment**

For the *TramoSeatsDoc-\#number* and *X13Doc-\#number* documents the
seasonal adjustment processes is launched automatically and the results
are displayed, once the user drags and drops series into the relevant
place of the document.

In the case of the *SAProcessing-\#number* document the user is expected
to drag and drop the series into it and launch the process by clicking
on the *Start* button (the green arrow marked in the picture below).


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic31.jpg)



**The results of a seasonal adjustment process**

When the user clicks on an individual time series in the
*SAProcessing-\#number* window, the detailed results are displayed in
the panel below the list of the series.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic32.jpg)



**The detailed results of the seasonal adjustment process for a selected time series**

For each seasonal adjustment method the structure of the output is the
same. The results of the seasonal adjustment process are divided into
six parts: *Input, Main results, Pre-processing, Decomposition,
Benchmarking* and *Diagnostics.* They are organised in an expandable
tree structure. To investigate a specific node, click on it in the panel
on the left to display its content in the panel on the right. Study the
content of the section using the vertical scrollbar.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic33.jpg)



**The seasonal adjustment results**

The structure and the content of the output presented in the [*Input*](../reference-manual/input.html) and
[*Pre-processing*](../reference-manual/model-generalities.html) nodes is the same for both seasonal adjustment methods. The content of the
other nodes depends on the decomposition method. As both methods vary
substantially in their approach to the decomposition, the description of
the output is presented separately for both methods.

### SA Specifications

att : modelling part : what is different, enlever les infos en double
voir si tjs en double dans v3

Seasonal adjustment can be performed with pre-defined or user-defined specifications. 
In general, these specifications include also a modelling part, which is descibed under the [Modelling section](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html).
Specifications are sets of parameters and values assigned to 
them that contain all information necessary for seasonal adjustment. 
The specifications for seasonal adjustment can be used for processing of a single time series as well as a large dataset.
The default critical values used by
the tests included in the specifications can be changed by the user in
the [*Tools* \\(\rightarrow\\) *Options* menu](../reference-manual/tools.html#options).


#### Pre-defined specifications


The *Seasonal adjustment* section of the *Workspace* window contains a
set of pre-defined specifications that enables the user to seasonally
adjust the time series using two methods: TRAMO-SEATS and
X-13ARIMA-SEATS.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic19.jpg)



**A set of pre-defined seasonal adjustment specifications**


The set of pre-defined specifications for seasonal adjustment
encompasses the most commonly used sets of seasonal adjustment
parameters. The names of these pre-defined specifications correspond to
the terminology used in TSW+. The users are strongly recommended to
start their analysis with one of those specifications (usually *RSA4c*
or *RSA5c* for X-13ARIMA-SEATS and *RSA4*, *RSA5* or *RSAfull* for
TRAMO-SEATS). The user is expected to adjust the specification to the
specific needs the using the [*Specification* button](../case-studies/modelling-advanced.html). The default specification for TRAMO-SEATS
and multi-documents is *RSAfull*, while for X-13ARIMA-SEATS it is RSA4c.

**Explanations for settings:**

-   **Transformation test** â€“ a test is performed to choose between an
    additive decomposition (no transformation) and a multiplicative
    decomposition (logarithmic transformation).

-   **Pre-adjustment for leap-year** â€“ a correction of the February
    values, which is applied to the original series before the
    logarithmic transformation. The original values in February are
    multiplied by \\(\frac{28.25}{29}\\) for leap years and by
    \\(\frac{28.25}{28}\\) for non-leap years. Values for other months
    are not modified.

-   **Working days** â€“ a pre-test is made for a presence of a working
    day effect.

-   **Trading days** â€“ a pre-test is made for a presence of a trading
    day effect.

-   **Easter** â€“ a pre-test for a presence of the Easter effect. The
    default length of the Easter effect is 6 days (for TRAMO-SEATS
    specifications) and 8 days (for X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications).

-   **Outliers** â€“ an automatic identification of three types of
    outliers: AO (additive outliers), LS (level shifts) and TC
    (transitory changes), using a default critical value.

-   **ARIMA model** â€“ the choice between fixing the ARIMA model
    structure to (0,1,1)(0,1,1) or searching for the ARIMA model using
    an automatic model identification procedure (AMI). The
    (0,1,1)(0,1,1) model (called the Airline model) is used as a
    default model in several TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS
    specifications because it has been shown in many studies that this
    model is appropriate for many real seasonal monthly or a quarterly
    time series. Moreover, the Airline model approximates well many
    other models and provides an excellent "benchmark" model[^10].

#### User-defined specifications


The user may add new seasonal adjustment specifications to the
*Workspace* window. To do it, go to the *Seasonal adjustment* section,
right click on the *tramoseats* or *x13* item in the *specifications*
node and select *New* from the local menu.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic20.jpg)



**Creating a new specification in the *Seasonal adjustment* section**

Next, double click on the newly created specification, change the
settings accordingly and confirm with the **OK** button.

### Defining and modifying a specification

In general, the user can choose the parameters of the seasonal
adjustment process by creating a specification with given settings or by
changing some settings in the specification currently in use.

1.  To create a new specification go to the *Workspace* window and choose a
    node, to which you wish to add a specification (*Modelling* or
    *Seasonal adjustment*). Then choose a method (*tramo* or *regarima* for
    *Modelling*, *tramoseats* or *x13* for *Seasonal adjustment*). Click
    on the left mouse button and choose a *New* option. The user can
    also import the specification from the external file with the
    *Import from* option.
	
	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image1.jpg)

	

	**Creating a new specification**

2.  Next, unfold the node (the *tramoseats* node in the case presented
    here) and right click on the newly created specification
    (*TramoSeatsSpec-1* in the case presented below) to open the local
    menu. The local menu offers the following options:

	-   **Open** -- displays the specification's settings

	-   **Export to** -- enables the user to save the specification in a
		config file.

	-   **Delete** -- removes the specification from the workspace.

	-   **Rename** -- enables the user to change the name of the
		user-defined specification.

	-   **Edit comments** -- a functionality for monitoring how a seasonal
		adjustment process is implemented. The user can add and modify short
		notes concerning a given time series. These notes are visible in the
		*Comments* column in the *Processing* window. The notes are displayed
		when the user hovers the mouse on the given cell.

	-   **Create document** -- adds a new document to the relevant place in
		the *Seasonal adjustment â†’ documents* section and assigns the
		specification selected by the user to it.

	-   **Clone** -- creates the copy of the specification and adds it to
		the list.

	Chose **Open** from the menu.
 
	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image2.jpg)

	
	
	**Opening a new specification**

3.  The *Specification* window is divided into several sections. The
    actual content depends on the choice made by the user in step 1
    of this scenario. To introduce changes unfold the sections, modify
    the current settings (choose from the list or insert the value by
    hand) and confirm the changes with the *OK* button.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image3.jpg)

	
	**Modifying a new specification**

4.  User-defined specifications are usually used for seasonal adjustment
    of many time series (*Statistical methods* â†’ *Seasonal adjustment* â†’
    *Multi Processing* â†’ *New*). The user can also make changes to the specification
    after the modelling/seasonal adjustment process. In such a case, to
    introduce changes click on the *Specification* button. JDemetra+
    opens the *Specifications* panel on the right. Unfold the sections,
    modify the current settings (choose from the list or type a new value)
	and confirm the changes with the *Apply* button. JDemetra+
    automatically applies the new settings and displays the outcome
    resulting from the modified specification.

	**Modifying a specification, which is currently in use**

### Creating an SAProcessing

vs document : only here output and cruncher


1.  Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* â†’
    *Seasonal adjustment* â†’ *Multi Processing* â†’ *New* to open a
    multi-document.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image19.jpg)

	

	**Launching the seasonal adjustment for a
datasets with multiple time series**

2.  JDemetra+ opens an empty window (default name: *SAProcessing-1*). By
    default, one of the [pre-defined specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#pre-defined-specifications)
	will be used for the seasonal
    adjustment of the dataset. To change the specification used for an
    adjustment in the current document, click on the button marked in
    the picture below. This will provide you with the alternative
    methods of adjustment. 

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image20.jpg)

	
 
	**Default window for seasonal adjustment process of the dataset**

3.  The list available from the *SAProcessing* window includes the
    pre-defined specifications and the [user-defined specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#user-defined-specifications) (if
    any). Click on the specification that will be used for the
    seasonal adjustment (in the example below *RSA4* is selected).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image21.jpg)

	

	**Choice of the specification**

4.  Drag and drop series from the *Providers* window to the
    *SAProcessing* window. You can drag and drop individual series or an
    entire dataset (i.e. a set of series that have been imported
    together, e.g. series from the same Excel file). It is possible to
    drag and drop the same series several times. It allows the user to
    apply different specifications to the same time series in order to
    compare the results. The series visible in the *SAProcessing* window
    are not seasonally adjusted yet (*Status* -- \"Unprocessed\").
    The adjustment will be performed using *RSA4* specification. For a newly
    created *SAProcessing* window the *Estimation* column is always set
    to *Concurrent*, which means that previous results for these time
    series will not be taken into account once this seasonal adjustment
    is launched (as they do not exist). However, a seasonal adjustment
    processing window may be saved and re-launched in the next session
    of JDemetra+. Then the user can decide [if and how the previous
    results will be taken into account in the current session](../case-studies/revision.html).
	At this stage the *Priority*, *Quality* and *Warnings* columns are empty as seasonal
    adjustment has not yet been performed.
	
	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image22.jpg)

	

	**Adding the series to the multi document**

5.  Once the user clicks on the start button (the button with a green
    arrow) the time series are processed, the statuses are updated and
    some information about the quality of the adjustments and possible
    problems are displayed in the *Warnings* column as exclamation
    marks.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image23.jpg)

	

	**The *Start* button**

6.  Generally, the warnings are put forward for short series,
    non-decomposable models (SEATS) or when the differenced series do
    not show seasonal peaks. Information on the warnings is displayed
    when the cursor hovers over an exclamation mark. 

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image24.jpg)

	

	**The results of a seasonal adjustment process**

7.  When the user clicks on an individual time series in the
    *SAProcessing* window, detailed results are displayed in the panel
    below the list of the series. By default, a summary of results is
    displayed, accompanied by two graphs: an overlay graph on the left with the original data,
    seasonally-adjusted series and the trend-cycle and the SI
    ratio graph on the right. These diagnostics and graphs are
    discussed [here](../reference-manual/output.html).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image25.jpg)

	

	**The inspection of the seasonal adjustment results for a chosen time series**

8.  The *Main results* panel provides information on the quality of the
    adjustment. Study the diagnostic section using the vertical
    scrollbar. The results are marked in green, yellow or red, depending
    on the result of a statistical test used. Those in green indicate that
    no problematic characteristic have been detected (e.g. lack of
    normality of residuals, autocorrelation in residuals). Yellow indicates that the test outcome is uncertain. The
    outcomes in red highlight cases where an issue should be addressed.
    Hence, test statistics will indicate the need (if any) to improve the model.
    Ideally, the model should be improved so that no test statistics
    indicate uncertainties in the results.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image26.jpg)

	

	**The diagnostics results -- simple seasonal adjustment of a multiple time series**

9.  To explore the results, expand the tree on the left and click on the
    desired node. Here the [*out-of-sample test*](../reference-manual/forecasts.html) was chosen.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image27.jpg)

	

	**Out-of-sample test results**

10. The specifications used for a seasonal adjustment of an individual
    series can be changed by clicking on the *Specifications* button as
    described [here](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html).

11. To export the output for a whole dataset, select the *Output* item
    from the *SAProcessing* menu.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image28.jpg)

	

	**The *SAProcessing* menu**

12. Expand the \"+\" menu and choose an appropriate data format (here
    Excel has been chosen). It is possible to save the results in TXT,
    XLS, CSV, and CSV matrix formats. Note that the [available content of
    the output depends on the output type](../theory/output.html).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image29.jpg)

	

	**Exporting data to an Excel file**

13. Specify [export details](../case-studies/output.html) and click *OK*. 

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image30.jpg)

	

	**Defining the export details**

14. To save the workspace that includes the results in the processing
    window (named *SAProcessing-1* in the example) select *Save
    Workspace As...* item from the *File* menu.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image31.jpg)

	

	**Saving the workspace**

15. Enter the location and the workspace name and click *Save.*

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image31_1.jpg)

	

	**Saving details**

16. The document is visible in the *Workspace* window under the
    multi-documents branch.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image32.jpg)

	

	**The content of the context menu for a multi-document**

17. The document can be opened, deleted or renamed from the context
    menu. The user can also [add comments to the document](../reference-manual/saprocessingdoc.html).
    When JDemetra+ is launched again the saved workspace can be opened
    and the multi-document can be run again.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image33.jpg)

	

	**Reopening the multi-document**

18. The seasonal adjustment can be refreshed by clicking on the green
    arrow button or by choosing the [refresh](../case-studies/revision.html) option from *SAProcessing*
    menu (note that the name of this main menu item corresponds to the
    name of the processing window).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image34.jpg)

	

	**Refreshing option**
	
### SAProcessing Options 

*SAProcessingDoc*-*\#number* is a main menu item that includes
functionalities designated for multi-documents. This item is displayed
in the main menu of the application when [a newly created or existing
multi-document](../reference-manual/output.html) is active. Note that some options are inactive when none
of the time series in the *SAProcessing* window is marked.



![Text](All_images/image3_RMSB.jpg)



**The *SAProcessing* menu for a newly created *X13* document**

The *SAProcessingDoc*-*\#number* menu facilitates the management of the
multi-document.


![Text](All_images/image4_RMSB.jpg)



**SAProcessing menu**

The available options include:

-   **Default specification** -- opens the window that contains the list
    of available specifications (both pre-defined and user-defined).

-   **Start** -- runs the seasonal adjustment of the times series
    included in the document.

-   **Refresh** -- refreshes a document with new data using one of the
    revisions policies. This option is only available for
    multi-documents saved during a previous session with JDemetra+. The
    description of refresh policies and step-by-step demonstration of
    how to use them can be found [here](../case-studies/revision.html).

-   **Accept** -- for a marked series the option allows the user to
    accept the results that JDemetra+ marks as not satisfactory.
    However, the option changes the entry in the *Quality* column in the
    *SAProcessing* window into **Accepted**, regardless of the initial
    value of this field. The **Accept** function can be used to
    distinguish the series for which the results have been examined by
    the user from those not checked yet. The option can be also
    activated from the local menu. To use it, first the series in the
    *SAProcessing* window need to be marked as it is shown in the
    picture below.

-   **Copy spec. to workspace** -- copy the specification of the active
    document into the workspace. In that way, it can be used for other
    processing.


![Text](All_images/image5_RMSB.jpg)



**The impact of the *Accept* option on the view of the results in the multi-document**

-   **Edit** -- allows for modification of the content of
    multi-document. New time series can be added to the multi-document
    directly from the external source, e.g. Excel (**Paste**). Before
    choosing this option the user should copy the time series (data,
    name of the time series and dates). For the series marked in the
    multi-document the **Copy** option copies the specification's
    details. It can be pasted into external application. Similarly, the
    **Copy series** option copies the time series, which can be then
    pasted to the another application. Both **Cut** and **Delete**
    remove the marked time series from the multi-document. **Copy
    components** is a functionality for coping selected output items in
    a quick and easy way.

-   **Clear selection** -- unmarks the series in the *SAProcessing*
    window. This option is inactive when none of the time series in the
    *SAProcessing* window is marked.

-   **Specification** -- enables the user to change the specification
    used for seasonal adjustment of a selected series to the one chosen
    from the list of the pre-defined and user-defined specifications.

-   **Priority** -- indicator that can be used to mark series that
    require more or less attention. The **Priority** parameter takes
    values from 0 to 10. JDemetra+ computes it automatically, based on
    the average of the (logged) series. The user can chose the method of
    its computation (log-based or level based).

-   **Initial Order** -- displays times series on the list in an initial
    order.

-   **Output** -- enables the user to export the results to a given
    output format (TXT, XLS, ODBC, CSV, CSV matrix), to specify the
    destination folder and to customise the content of the exported
    file. The list of available output items is determined by the chosen
    output format and it can be found [here](../theory/output.html). The **Output** option is
    discussed in detail [here](../case-studies/output.html).

-   **Report** -- generates a summary report from a multi-process that
    includes summary information on several items, such as; the number of series, specifications
    used, models' summary, diagnostic summary, etc.. An example of the output
    is presented below.


![Text](All_images/image6_RMSB.png)




**The report from the multi-process**

-   **Edit comments** -- a functionality for monitoring a seasonal
    adjustment process is implemented. The user can add and modify short
    notes concerning a given time series. These notes are visible in the
    *Comments* column in the *Processing* window. The notes are
    displayed when the user hovers the mouse on the given cell.


![Text](All_images/image7_RMSB.png)



**A comment displayed in the *Processing* window**

To add or edit a comment the user can also click on the series in the
*Processing* panel and chose an option *Edit comments* from the local
menu.

### SAProcessing Menu

*Advanced seasonal adjustment* scenarios present an in-depth analysis
of seasonal adjustment results for time series generated with the
user-defined specifications. They are intended for the advanced users
who already have some practical experience of seasonal adjustment. They
focus on how to correct the deficiencies of the specification and
improve the modelling.
Links to the appropriate parts of the [*Reference Manual*](../reference-manual/) 
for detailed explanations are provided
when necessary.

#### Choosing parameters of seasonal adjustment process

This section guides the user through functions that can be used in the
process of seasonal adjustment of a single time series. It explains how
to use available options to enhance the automatically selected seasonal
adjustment model. This part is divided into several case studies. Each
of them address a given issue and suggests how to deal with it.

As a prerequisite, the [*single time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario should be studied. The majority of
the case studies in this section concern working with modelling or
seasonal adjustment specifications. These issues are explained in the [*seasonal adjustment specification*](../case-studies/detailedsa-spec.html) scenario.


#### Detailed seasonal adjustment of multiple time series

This part guides the user through useful functions that can be used in
the regular production of seasonally adjusted data, like summarising the
results, saving and refreshing options. This part is divided into
several case studies. Each of them focuses on a given issue and presents
available options.

As a prerequisite, the [*simple seasonal adjustment of multiple time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-muliple.html) scenario should be studied. The specification
for each series included in the multi-document can be modified using the instructions from the [*Defining and modifying a specification*](../case-studies/detailedsa-spec.html) specification.
Although the case studies presented in
this section are intended for the datasets, they can be also performed
for a single time series, provided that the analysis is done in a
multi-document (the user is expected to follow the path *Statistical
methods* â†’ *Seasonal adjustment* â†’ *Multi Processing* â†’ *New*).


Once a seasonal adjustment process for multiple time series is initiated
a relevant item appears in the main menu. It includes the following
options:

-   *Default specification â€“* displays a list of pre-defined specifications.

-   *Start â€“* runs the defined seasonal adjustment process. The item is active when some of the series included into SA-Processing window are unprocessed**.**

-   *Refresh* â€“ refresh a process with new data. Option is active when the previously saved workspace is opened and a relevant multi-document opened. For description of the *Refresh* options refer to the [*Revision policies*](../case-studies/revision.html) section.

-   *Accept* â€“ for a time series marked in the *SA-Processing* window this option sets the *Quality* value to *Accepted*. This option is helpful when the user wishes to indicate the series for which the results have been reviewed and accepted by the user.

-   *Edit* â€“ allows to modify the content of the specification by *Copy*, *Copy Series,* *Paste, Delete* and *Cut* the time series that is marked in the multi-processing window.

-   *Clear selection* â€“ unmarks series selected in the *SA-Processing* window.

-   *Specificationâ€¦* â€“ enables the user to pick a seasonal adjustment specification from the list. The chosen specification will be applied to the time series once processed.

-   *Priority* â€“ an indicator that can be used to mark a series that require more or less attention. Priorities take values from 0 to 10. JDemetra+ computes them automatically, based on the average of the (logged) series. The user can choose the method of computation (log-based or level based).

-   *Initial order* â€“ displays the times series on the list in their initial order. The option restores the initial order if the list has been sorted by given column (e.g. by quality or method).

-   *Outputâ€¦* â€“ offers a set of output formats (TXT, XLS, ODBC, CSV, CSV matrix), the choice of the folder that will contain the results and the content of the exported file.

-   *Reportâ€¦* â€“ displays a summary report concerning the processing, including, e.g. number of series, specifications used, models used and diagnostic results.

### Diagnostics : Chart Arima spectrum

The *Arima* section demonstrates [a theoretical spectrum](../theory/spectral.html) of the
stationary and non-stationary models. The local menu, which is available
for the graph, offers the copy and export options, including sending the
graph to the printer and saving the graph as clipboard or as a file in
the PNG format. The *Copy all visible* option enables the user to export
time series data to the another application.



![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic02.jpg)



**Theoretical spectrum of the ARIMA model**

In the bottom part the panel [the ARIMA model](../theory/SA_lin.html) used by TRAMO is presented
using symbolic notation \\((P,D,Q)(PB,DB,QB)\\). Estimated
parametersâ€™ coefficients (regular and seasonal AR and MA) are shown in
closed form (i.e. using the backshift operator[^3] \\(B\\)). For each
regular AR root (i.e. the solution of the characteristic equation) the
[argument and modulus](../theory/SA_SEATS.html#derivation-of-the-models-for-the-components) are given.



![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic03.jpg)



**The details of ARIMA model used for modelling**

For each regular AR root the argument and modulus are also reported (if
present, i.e. if \\(\mathbf{P > 0}\\)) to inform to which time series
component the regular roots would be assigned.



[^3]: A backshift operator \\(B\ \\)is defined as: ($B^{k}x_{t} = x_{t - k})$. It is used to denote lagged series.





#### Series

In the context of seasonal adjustment it is usually assumed that long
time series are those exceeding twenty years of length. Performing
seasonal adjustment of long time series can be difficult. Over such a
long period the underlying data generating process can change,
determining changes also in the components and in the components
structure. In this case the adjustment over the whole series may produce
sub-optimal results mainly in the most recent period and in the initial
parts of the series. Therefore it is reasonable to limit long time
series to the most recent observations. The *Series* section allows the
user to limit the span (data interval) of the data to be modelled or
seasonally adjusted.

###### **Series span â†’ type**<br> *--; --*

Specifies the span (data interval) of the time series to be used in the
seasonal adjustment process. When the user limits the original time
series to a given span, only this span will be used in the computations.
The available parameters for this option are: \* *All* -- full time
series span is considered in the seasonal adjustment; \* *From* -- date
of the first time series observation is included in the seasonal
adjustment; \* *To* -- date of the last time series observation is
included in the seasonal adjustment; \* *Between* -- dates of the first
and the last time series observations are included in the seasonal
adjustment; \* *Last* -- a specific number of observations from the end
of the time series is included in the seasonal adjustment; \* *First* --
a specific number of observations from the beginning of the time series
is included in the seasonal adjustment; \* *Excluding* -- a specific
number of observations is excluded from the beginning (*First*) and/or
end (*Last*) of the time series in the seasonal adjustment. With the
options *Last*, *First* and *Excluding* the span can be computed
dynamically on the series. The default setting is *All*.

###### **Series span â†’ Preliminary check**<br> *--; --*

When marked, it checks the quality of the input series and excludes from
a processing the highly problematic ones: e.g. these with a high number
of outliers, identical observations and/or missing values above the
respective threshold values. When unmarked, the thresholds are ignored
and process is performed, when possible. By default, the checkbox is
marked.

#### Seats

This section includes the settings relevant for the decomposition step,
performed by the [SEATS algorithm](../theory/SA_SEATS.html).

###### **Prediction length**<br> *Seats parameters; npred*

Number of forecasts used in the decomposition. Positive values
correspond to the number of months while negative values correspond to
the numbers of years.

###### **Approximation mode**<br> *Seats parameters; noadmiss*

In general, SEATS decomposes the ARIMA model received from TRAMO. On
some occasions, the ARIMA model identified by TRAMO results in a so
called non-admissible decomposition i.e. a decomposition for which the
condition that all components have a non-negative spectrum for all
frequencies has failed. In such cases an approximation might be used to
choose an acceptable ARIMA model. The available actions that can be
performed in the case of a non-admissible decomposition are:

-   *None* -- when the model does not accept an admissible
    decomposition, no approximation is made, which means that no
    decomposition is performed by SEATS.
-   *Legacy* -- when the model does not accept an admissible
    decomposition, it is automatically replaced with a decomposable one.
    The forecasts of the components obtained from SEATS with a new ARIMA
    model (sum of the components forecasts) will not add to the series
    forecast of the model passed by TRAMO.
-   *Noisy* -- a new ARIMA model is obtained by adding a white noise to
    the non-admissible model estimated by TRAMO. In this case, the
    forecasts of the series from TRAMO and from SEATS are the same; also
    the sum of the components forecasts is the same as the forecast of
    the series with the TRAMO model.

The default setting is *Legacy*.

###### **MA unit root boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; xl*

A parameter to control the estimation of the AR and MA roots of the
model. When the modulus of a root converges within an interval around 1,
the program automatically fixes the root. More specifically, when the
modulus of an estimated root falls in the range
(<em>xl</em><strong>,</strong> 1), it is set to 1 if it is a root in the
AR polynomial. If a root is in the MA polynomial, it is set to *xl*. The
default value is 0.95.

###### **Trend boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; rmod*

The trend boundary is defined for the modulus of the inverse of the real
AR roots. If the modulus of the inverse of the real root is greater than
the <strong>Trend boundary</strong>, the AR root is integrated into the
trend component. Otherwise the root is integrated into the seasonal
component or transitory component (see <strong>Seasonal
boundary</strong>). The default parameter value is 0.5.

###### **Seasonal tolerance**<br> *Seats parameters; epsphi*

The tolerance (measured in degrees) to allocate the AR non-real roots to
the seasonal component (if the modulus of the inverse complex AR root is
greater than the <strong>Trend boundary</strong> and the frequency of
this root differs from one of the seasonal frequencies by less than
<strong>Seasonal tolerance</strong>) or the transitory component
(otherwise). The default parameter value is [$\frac{\pi}{90}$]{.math
.inline} rad (2 degrees).

###### **Seasonal boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; smod*

The seasonal boundary is defined for the modulus of the inverse of the
real negative AR roots. If the modulus of the inverse negative real root
is greater (or equal) than <strong>Seasonal boundary</strong>, the AR
root is integrated into the seasonal component. Otherwise the root is
integrated into the trend or transitory component (see <strong>Trend
boundary</strong>). The default parameter value is 0.8.

###### **Seasonal boundary (unique)**<br> *Seats parameters; smod*

A boundary, from which a negative AR root is integrated in the seasonal
component when the root is the unique seasonal root. The default
parameter value is 0.8.

###### **Method**<br> *--; --*

The estimation method of the unobserved components.

Options: - *Burman* -- the algorithm, which is used by the original
TRAMO/SEATS method. Although it is the most efficient one, it cannot
handle MA unit roots and it may become numerically unstable when some
roots of the MA polynomial are near 1. In such cases the
Wiener-Kolmogorov approach may lead to a significant underestimation of
the standard deviations of the components. - *KalmanSmoother* -- the
most robust algorithm. It is not disturbed by (quasi-) unit roots in MA.
It is slightly slower than the Burman's
algorithm[^graphical-user-interface-3]. It should also be noted that it
provides exact measures of the standard errors of the estimates
(identical to the McElroy's results). - *McElroyMatrix* -- the
algorithm, which is much slower than the two other options and presents
the same stability issues as the Burman's algorithm. However, it
provides additional results (full covariance matrix of the estimates)
that may be useful.

[^graphical-user-interface-3]: Description of the idea of benchmarking
    is based on Dagum, B.E., Cholette, P.A. 1994), and Quenneville, B.
    et all (2003). Detailed information can be found in: Dagum, B.E.,
    Cholette, P.A. (2006).

The default setting is *Burman*.

### Reg arima linearization

The *Model* node includes basic information about the outcome of the
model identification procedure and checking the goodness of fit. The
summary information about the final model is available directly from the
main *Model* node. The content of this panel depends on the
[settings](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html) applied to
the modelling procedure.

![Text](All_images/image22_RMSB.jpg)

**The *Model* node in the navigation tree**

The first part contains fundamental information about the model.

![Text](All_images/image23_RMSB.jpg)

**The *Summary* section of the *Model* node**

*Estimation span* informs about the first and the last observation used
for modelling. The notation of the estimation span varies according to
the frequencies (for example, the span $$2-1993 : 10-2006$$ represents a
monthly time series and the span $$II-1994 : I-2011$$ represents a
quarterly time series). The message *Series has been log-transformed* is
only displayed if a logarithmic transformation has been applied.

In the case of [the pre-defined
specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html): TR0,
TR1, TR3, RG0, RG1 and RG3 no trading day effect is estimated. For TR2,
RG2c, TR4 and RG4c pre-defined specifications, working day effects and
the leap year effect are pre-tested and estimated if present. If the
working day effect is significant, the pre-processing part includes the
message *Working days effect (1 regressor)*. The message *Working days
effect (2 regressors)* means that the leap year effect has also been
estimated. For TR5 and RG5c the trading day effect and the leap year
effect are pre-tested. If the trading day effect has been detected,
either of the messages *Trading days effect (6 regressors)* or *Trading
days effect (7 regressors)* are displayed, depending whether the leap
year effect has been detected or not. If the Easter effect is
statistically significant, *Easter effect detected* is displayed.

In this section the total number of detected outliers is displayed. The
additional information on detected outliers, i.e. type, location and
coefficients' values, can be found in the *Arima model* subsection of
the *Model* node.

The *Final model* section informs about the outcome of the estimation
process. *Number of effective observations* is the number of
observations used to estimate the model, i.e. the number of observations
of the transformed series (regularly and/or seasonally differenced)
reduced by the *Number of estimated parameters*, which is the sum of
regular and seasonal parameters for both autoregressive and moving
average processes, mean effect, trading/working day effect, outliers,
regressors and one.

*Likelihood* is a maximized value of a
Likelihood[^graphical-user-interface-4] function after the iterations
processed in Exact Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which is a method used
to estimate the model. This value is used by the model selection
criteria: *AIC*, *AICC*, *BIC (corrected by length)* and
*Hannan-Quinn*[^graphical-user-interface-5]. *Standard error of the
regression (ML estimate)* is the standard error of the regression from
Maximum Likelihood Estimation[^graphical-user-interface-6].

[^graphical-user-interface-4]: The likelihood function is the joint
    probability (density) function of observable random variables. It is
    viewed as the function of the parameters given the realized random
    variables. Therefore, this function measures the probability of
    observing the particular set of dependent variable values that occur
    in the sample.

[^graphical-user-interface-5]: [AIC, AICC, BIC and Hannan-Quinn criteria
    are used by X-13ARIMA-SEATS while BIC (TRAMO
    definition)](../theory/SA_lin.html#model-selection-criteria) by
    TRAMO/SEATS. These criteria are used in seasonal adjustment
    procedures for the selection of the optimum ARIMA model. The model
    with the smaller value of the model selection criteria is preferred.

[^graphical-user-interface-6]: Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a
    statistical method for estimating the coefficients of a model. This
    method determines the parameters that maximize the probability
    (likelihood) of the sample data.

The *scores at the solution* section presents the gradient of the
loglikelihood. The different items of the scores are related to the
different parameters of the ARIMA model. The output indicates to which
extent the optimization procedure reached the maximum. At the maximum of
the likelihood, it should be 0. However, it is never exactly the case,
due to numerical approximations. Usually, the scores can be improved by
using a higher precision (smaller tolerance). This precision is
controlled by the **Tolerance** parameter in the **Estimate** section of
the *Specifications* window (see how to use this parameter [for
Tramo](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#estimate) and [for
Arima](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#estimate)).

An example of the output is presented in the chart below.

![Text](All_images/image24_RMSB.jpg)

**The content of the *Final model* section**

Next, the estimated values of model parameters (*Coefficients*),
t-statistics (*T-Stat*) and corresponding p-values (*P*$$\|T\|\>t$$) are
displayed. JDemetra+ uses the following notation:

-   *Phi(p)* -- the \\(p\^{\text{th}}\\) term in the non-seasonal
    autoregressive polynomial;

-   *Theta(q)* -- the $q^{\text{th}}$ term in the non-seasonal moving
    average polynomial;

-   *BPhi(P)* -- the $P^{\text{th}}$ term in the seasonal autoregressive
    polynomial;

-   *BTheta(Q)* -- the $Q^{\text{th}}$ term in the seasonal moving
    average polynomial.

In the example below, the ARIMA model (0,1,1)(0,1,1) was chosen, which
means that one regular and one seasonal moving average parameter were
identified and estimated. The p-values indicate that *BTheta(1)*
parameter is significant in contrast to the *Theta(1)*, which is not
significant [^graphical-user-interface-7].

[^graphical-user-interface-7]: The variable is called statistically
    significant if it is so extreme that such a result would be expected
    to arise simply by chance only in rare circumstances (with the
    probability equal to p-value). Generally, the regressor is thought
    to be significant if p-value is lower than 5%.

![Text](All_images/image25_RMSB.jpg)

**The estimation's results of the ARIMA model**

For the [fixed ARIMA
parameters](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#tramo-specification--options-for-manual-identification-of-the-arima-model),
JDemetra+ shows only the values of the parameters. Figure below presents
the output from the manually chosen ARIMA model (2,0,0)(0,1,1) with a
fixed parameter *BTheta(1).* For the fixed parameter the *T-Stat* and
*(P\|T\|\>t)* are not displayed as no estimation is done for this
parameter.

![Text](All_images/image26_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the ARIMA model with a fixed
coefficient**

If the ARIMA model contains a constant term (detected automatically or
introduced by the user), the estimated value and related statistics are
reported.

![Text](All_images/image27_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a mean effect**

JDemetra+ presents estimated values of the coefficients of one or six
regressors depending on the type of a calendar effect specification. For
a working days effect one regressor is estimated.

![Text](All_images/image28_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a working day effect**

When a trading days effect is estimated the *Joint F-test* value is
reported under the table that presents estimated values. When the result
of *Joint F-test* indicates that the trading day variables are jointly
not significant the test result is displayed in red.

![Text](All_images/image29_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a trading day effect: the case of
jointly not significant variables**

In the example below the RSA5c specification has been used and a trading
day effect has been detected. In spite of the fact that some trading day
regressors are not significant at the 5% significance level, the outcome
of the joint F-test indicates that the trading day regressors are
jointly significant (the F-test statistic is lower than 5%).

![Text](All_images/image30_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a trading day effect: the case of
jointly significant variables**

If a leap year regressor has been used in the model specification, the
value of the estimated leap year coefficient is also reported with the
corresponding t-statistics and p-value. As the p-value presented on the
picture below is greater than 0.05, it indicates that the leap year
effect is not significant.

![Text](All_images/image31_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a leap year effect**

When the option
[*UserDefined*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression)
is used, JDemetra+ displays the *User-defined calendar variables*
section with variables and corresponding estimation results (the values
of the parameters, corresponding t-statistics and p-values). The outcome
of the joint F-test is displayed when more than one user-defined
calendar variable is used.

![Text](All_images/image32_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of user-defined calendar variables**

When the Easter effect is estimated, the following table is displayed in
the output. In the case presented below Easter has a negative,
significant effect on the time series.

![Text](All_images/image33_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the Easter effect**

JDemetra+ also presents the results of an outlier detection procedure.
The table includes the type of outlier, its date, the value of the
coefficient and corresponding t-statistics and p-values.

![Text](All_images/image34_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the outlier identification procedure**

In all pre-defined specifications, except for TR0 and RG0, only additive
outliers, temporary changes and level shifts are considered in the
automatic outlier identification procedure. When seasonal outliers are
also enabled, they appear in the same table as other outliers.

![Text](All_images/image35_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the outlier identification procedure that enables
seasonal outliers**

Results for [pre-specified
outliers](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression) are
displayed in a separate table.

![Text](All_images/image36_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the pre-specified outliers**

Regression variables, like ramps and intervention variables, are not
identified automatically. They need to be defined by the user. The
results of an estimation of ramps that are pre-defined types of
regression variables are displayed in a separate table. All information
concerning ramps, including spans, estimated coefficients and related
statistics, is shown in a separate table.

![Text](All_images/image37_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the ramp effect**

All other intervention variables with corresponding statistics are shown
under the *Intervention variable(s)* table.

![Text](All_images/image38_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the intervention variable**

User-defined variables are marked as *Vars-1.x_1, Vars-1.x_2*, ...,
*Vars-1.x_n* and displayed in the separate tables.

![Text](All_images/image39_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the user-defined variables**

JDemetra+ also reports a list of missing observations, if any. JDemetra+
applies the AO approach to the estimation of the missing
observations[^graphical-user-interface-8].

[^graphical-user-interface-8]: Missing observations are treated as
    additive outliers and interpolated accordingly.

![Text](All_images/image40_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the missing observations**

Detailed results are divided into several sections and are investigated
in the following sections: -
[Forecasts](../reference-manual/forecasts.html) -
[Regressors](../reference-manual/regressors.html) -
[ARIMA](../reference-manual/arima.html) - [Pre-adjustment

### Series span and model span*

general info
implementation  
link to GUI 
link to R

By default, JDemetra+ performs an analysis on the whole span available for
a time series. However, in some cases there is a need to limit an
analysis to a subset (span) of the time series.

According to the Guidelines on seasonal adjustment (2015), *"in the
context of seasonal adjustment it is possible to assume heuristically
that long time series are those exceeding twenty years of length.
Performing seasonal adjustment of long time series can be difficult.
Over such a long period the underlying data generating process may
change, determining changes also in the components and in the components
structure. In this case, to perform the adjustment over the whole series
may produce sub-optimal results, mainly in the most recent and the
initial parts of the series. Therefore it is reasonable to limit long
time series to the most recent observations".*

Another case in which the limitation of a time series can be considered is
the presence of a peak in the spectrum from the seasonally adjusted series
or irregulars[^3]. Also a change to the method or timing of data
collection might be a reason for a shortening a time series.

JDemetra+ offers two useful options to deal with the issue of the length
of time series: *Model span* and *Series span*. 

With the *Series span* the user can determine a sub-series on which 
he wants to run the seasonal adjustement or modelling process.

Then he can determine an even shorter *Model span*, which is the sub-series 
on which the pre-adjustement regressions and the Arima model will be estimated. 
This option can be chosen when, for example the user does not want data early in the
series to affect the forecasts, or, alternatively, data late in the
series to affect regression estimates used for the pre-adjustment.

The final modelling and decomposition of the series will be performed on the *Series span* using 
the settings determined with the *Model span*.


![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image36.jpg)



**The *Model span* options**

Both Tramo-Seats and X-13ARIMA-SEATS offer the same set of options for [*Series span*](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html)
and [*Model span*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#estimate) parameters. 



[^3]: *Guide to seasonal adjustment with X-12-ARIMA* (2007).


### Specifications for TramoSeats method

This section discusses the options available for the TRAMO-SEATS
specifications, which are based on the original program developed by
Agustin Maravall and Victor GÃ³mez. It is divided into five parts that
correspond to the TRAMO-SEATS specification sections and are presented
in the order in which they are displayed in the graphical interface of
JDemetra+.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic22.jpg)



**A list of the TRAMO-SEATS specificationâ€™s sections**

To avoid unnecessary repetitions, click on the respective link for a description of the following sections of the TRAMO/SEATS specification:

* [*Estimate*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#estimate); 
* [*Transformation*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#transformation); 
* [*Regression*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression); 
* [*Outliers*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#outliers);
* [*Arima*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#arima).
 
This section focuses on the decomposition part of the seasonal adjustment process and the
options for benchmarking.

To facilitate the comparison between JDemetra+ specifications and
specifications used in TSW+, under each option the name of the
corresponding parameter from the original software is given, if any. For
an exact description of the different parameters originating from TSW+,
the user should refer to the documentation of TSW+. For each parameter
the default parameter value, which is displayed for a template created
in the *Workspace* window, is reported.

For the pre-defined specifications the items are fixed, while in the
case of the user-defined specifications the user can set them
individually. However, in some cases the choice of a given value results
in a limitation of the possible alternatives for other parameters.
Therefore, the user is not entirely free to set the parameters values.

#### Series

In the context of seasonal adjustment it is usually assumed that long
time series are those exceeding twenty years of length. Performing
seasonal adjustment of long time series can be difficult. Over such a
long period the underlying data generating process can change,
determining changes also in the components and in the components
structure. In this case the adjustment over the whole series may produce
sub-optimal results mainly in the most recent period and in the initial
parts of the series. Therefore it is reasonable to limit long time
series to the most recent observations. The *Series* section allows
the user to limit the span (data interval) of the data to be modelled or
seasonally adjusted.

###### **Series span â†’  type**<br> *â€“; â€“*

Specifies the span (data interval) of the time series to be used in the seasonal adjustment process. When the user limits the original time series to a given span, only this span will be used in the computations. The available parameters for this option are:
* *All* â€“ full time series span is considered in the seasonal adjustment;
* *From* â€“ date of the first time series observation is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *To* â€“ date of the last time series observation is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *Between* â€“ dates of the first and the last time series observations are included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *Last* â€“ a specific number of observations from the end of the time series is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *First* â€“ a specific number of observations from the beginning of the time series is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *Excluding* â€“ a specific number of observations is excluded from the beginning (*First*) and/or end (*Last*) of the time series in the seasonal adjustment.
With the options *Last*, *First* and *Excluding* the span can be computed dynamically on the series. The default setting is *All*.

###### **Series span â†’  Preliminary check**<br> *â€“; â€“*

When marked, it checks the quality of the input series and excludes from a processing the highly problematic 
ones: e.g. these with a high number of outliers, identical observations and/or missing values 
above the respective threshold values. 
When unmarked, the thresholds are ignored and process is performed, when possible. 
By default, the checkbox is marked.

#### Seats

This section includes the settings relevant for the decomposition step,
performed by the [SEATS algorithm](../theory/SA_SEATS.html).

###### **Prediction length**<br> *Seats parameters; npred*

Number of forecasts used in the decomposition. Positive values correspond to the number of months while negative values correspond to the numbers of years.

###### **Approximation mode**<br> *Seats parameters; noadmiss*

In general, SEATS decomposes the ARIMA model received from TRAMO. On some occasions, 
the ARIMA model identified by TRAMO results 
in a so called non-admissible decomposition i.e. a decomposition for which the condition that all components 
have a non-negative spectrum for all frequencies has failed. In such cases an approximation might be used to 
choose an acceptable ARIMA model. The available actions that can be performed in the case of a non-admissible 
decomposition are:

- *None* â€“ when the model does not accept an admissible decomposition, no approximation is made, which means that no decomposition is performed by SEATS.
- *Legacy* â€“ when the model does not accept an admissible decomposition, it is automatically replaced with a decomposable one. The forecasts of the components obtained from SEATS with a new ARIMA model (sum of the components forecasts) will not add to the series forecast of the model passed by TRAMO.
- *Noisy* â€“ a new ARIMA model is obtained by adding a white noise to the non-admissible model estimated by TRAMO. In this case, the forecasts of the series from TRAMO and from SEATS are the same; also the sum of the components forecasts is the same as the forecast of the series with the TRAMO model.

The default setting is *Legacy*.

###### **MA unit root boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; xl*

A parameter to control the estimation of the AR and MA roots of the model. When the modulus of a root converges within an interval around 1, the program automatically fixes the root. More specifically, when the modulus of an estimated root falls in the range (<em>xl</em><strong>,</strong> 1), it is set to 1 if it is a root in the AR polynomial. If a root is in the MA polynomial, it is set to *xl*. The default value is 0.95.

###### **Trend boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; rmod*

The trend boundary is defined for the modulus of the inverse of the real AR roots. If the modulus of the inverse of the real root is greater than the <strong>Trend boundary</strong>, the AR root is integrated into the trend component. Otherwise the root is integrated into the seasonal component or transitory component (see <strong>Seasonal boundary</strong>). The default parameter value is 0.5.

###### **Seasonal tolerance**<br> *Seats parameters; epsphi*

The tolerance (measured in degrees) to allocate the AR non-real roots to the seasonal component (if the modulus of the inverse complex AR root is greater than the <strong>Trend boundary</strong> and the frequency of this root differs from one of the seasonal frequencies by less than <strong>Seasonal tolerance</strong>) or the transitory component (otherwise). The default parameter value is <span class="math inline">$\frac{\pi}{90}$</span> rad (2 degrees).

###### **Seasonal boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; smod*

The seasonal boundary is defined for the modulus of the inverse of the real negative AR roots. If the modulus of the inverse negative real root is greater (or equal) than <strong>Seasonal boundary</strong>, the AR root is integrated into the seasonal component. Otherwise the root is integrated into the trend or transitory component (see <strong>Trend boundary</strong>). The default parameter value is 0.8.

###### **Seasonal boundary (unique)**<br> *Seats parameters; smod*

A boundary, from which a negative AR root is integrated in the seasonal component when the root is the unique seasonal root. The default parameter value is 0.8.

###### **Method**<br> *â€“; â€“*

The estimation method of the unobserved components. 

Options:
- *Burman* â€“ the algorithm, which is used by the original TRAMO/SEATS method. Although it is the most efficient one, it cannot handle MA unit roots and it may become numerically unstable when some roots of the MA polynomial are near 1. In such cases the Wiener-Kolmogorov approach may lead to a significant underestimation of the standard deviations of the components.
- *KalmanSmoother* â€“ the most robust algorithm. It is not disturbed by (quasi-) unit roots in MA. It is slightly slower than the Burman's algorithm[^1]. It should also be noted that it provides exact measures of the standard errors of the estimates (identical to the McElroy's results).
- *McElroyMatrix* â€“ the algorithm, which is much slower than the two other options and presents the same stability issues as the Burman's algorithm. However, it provides additional results (full covariance matrix of the estimates) that may be useful.

The default setting is *Burman*.


#### Benchmarking

The *Benchmarking* section allows for a [benchmarking](../theory/benchmarking.html), i.e. forcing the annual sums of the
seasonally adjusted data to be equal to the annual sums of the raw or
calendar adjusted data.

###### **Is enabled**<br> *â€“; â€“*

Enables the user to perform a benchmarking. By default, the checkbox is unmarked.

###### **Target**<br> *â€“; â€“*

Specifies the target variable for the benchmarking procedure.

- *Original* â€“ the raw time series are considered as a target data;
- *Calendar Adjusted* â€“ the time series adjusted for calendar effects are considered as a target data.

The default setting is *Original*.

###### **Use forecast**<br> *â€“; â€“*

The forecasts of the seasonally adjusted series and of the target variable (<strong>Target</strong>) are used in the benchmarking computation so the benchmarking constraint is applied also to the forecasting period. By default, the checkbox in unmarked (forecasts are not used).

###### **Rho**<br> *â€“; â€“*

The value of the AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). The default value of 1 is equivalent to the Denton benchmarking.

###### **Lambda**<br> *â€“; â€“*

A parameter that relates to the weights in the regression equation; it is typically equal to 0, 1/2 or 1. A parameter equal to 1 (default value) makes the method equivalent to the multiplicative benchmarking, while a parameter equal to 0 makes the method equivalent to the additive benchmarking.


[^1]: The disturbance filter of Koopman is nearly as fast as the Burmanâ€™s solution. However, it does not provide the standard deviations of the estimates.


### Specifications for X-13

This section discusses the options available for the X-13ARIMA-SEATS
specifications, which are based on the original X-13ARIMA-SEATS program
developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. The X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications
are *â€“* to a very large extent *â€“* organised according to the different
individual specifications of the original program and are presented in
the order in which they are displayed in the graphical interface of
JDemetra+.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic35.jpg)



**A list of the X-13ARIMA-SEATS specificationâ€™s sections**

To avoid unnecessary repetitions, click on the respective link for a description of the following sections of the TRAMO/SEATS specification:

* [*Estimate*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#estimate); 
* [*Transformation*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#transformation); 
* [*Regression*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#regression); 
* [*Outliers*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#outliers);
* [*Arima*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#arima).

This section focuses on the decomposition part of the seasonal adjustment process and
the benchmarking options.

To facilitate the comparison between JDemetra+ specifications and
specifications used in Win X-13, under each option the name of the
corresponding specification and the argument from the original software
is given, if any. For an exact description of the different parameters,
the user should refer to the documentation of the [original
X-13ARIMA-SEATS program](https://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/unix/qrefX13ASunix.pdf). For each parameter the default parameter
value, which is displayed for a template created in the *Workspace*
window, is reported (in the *Workspace* window go to the *Seasonal
Adjustment* section, right click on the *x13* item in the
*specifications* node and select *New* from the local menu).

For the pre-defined specifications the items are fixed, while in the
case of the user-defined specification the user can set them
individually. However, in some cases the choice of a given value results
in a limitation of the possible alternatives for other parameters.
Therefore, the user is not entirely free to set the parameters values.

#### Series

In the context of seasonal adjustment it is usually assumed that long
time series are those exceeding twenty years of length. Performing
seasonal adjustment of long time series can be difficult. Over such a
long period the underlying data generating process can change,
determining changes also in the components and in the components
structure. In this case the adjustment over the whole series may produce
sub-optimal results mainly in the most recent period and in the initial
parts of the series. Therefore it is reasonable to limit long time
series to the most recent observations. The *Series* section allows
the user to limit the span (data interval) of the data to modelled or
seasonally adjusted.

###### **Series span â†’  type**<br> *â€“; â€“*

Specifies the span (data interval) of the time series to be used in the seasonal adjustment process. When the user limits the original time series to a given span, only this span will be used in the computations. The available parameters for this option are:
* *All* â€“ full time series span is considered in the seasonal adjustment;
* *From* â€“ date of the first time series observation is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *To* â€“ date of the last time series observation is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *Between* â€“ dates of the first and the last time series observations are included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *Last* â€“ a specific number of observations from the end of the time series is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *First* â€“ a specific number of observations from the beginning of the time series is included in the seasonal adjustment;
* *Excluding* â€“ a specific number of observations is excluded from the beginning (*First*) and/or end (*Last*) of the time series in the seasonal adjustment.
With the options *Last*, *First* and *Excluding* the span can be computed dynamically on the series. The default setting is *All*.

###### **Series span â†’  Preliminary check**<br> *â€“; â€“*

When marked, it checks the quality of the input series and excludes from a processing the highly problematic 
ones: e.g. these with a high number of outliers, identical observations and/or missing values 
above the respective threshold values. 
When unmarked, the thresholds are ignored and process is performed, when possible. 
By default, the checkbox is marked.


#### X11

This section includes the settings relevant for the decomposition step,
performed by the [X11](../theory/SA_X11.html) algorithm.

###### **Mode**<br> *x11; mode*

Time series can be regard as a composition of distinctive components: trend, seasonal component, calendar component and irregular movements. For the decomposition purpose some assumptions need to be made concerning the aggregation function that combines the components to form the linearized (stochastic) time series. The <strong>Mode</strong> parameter determines the mode of the seasonal adjustment decomposition to be performed. The choice can be made between:
- *Undefined* â€“ no assumption concerning the relationship between the time series components is made.
- *Additive* â€“ an original time series is decomposed into a sum of the components.
- *Multiplicative* â€“ an original time series is decomposed assuming a multiplicative relationship between the components. It requires a bias correction for its trend and SA estimates[^1].
- *LogAdditive* â€“ performs an additive decomposition of the logarithms of the series being adjusted. It requires a bias correction for its trend estimates (due to geometric means being less than arithmetic means) as well as a different calibration for an extreme value identification, which is based on the log-normal distribution[^2].
   If [<strong>Transformation</strong>](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#transformation) is set to <em>Log</em> the <strong>Mode</strong> parameter should be set to <em>Undefined</em> (<em>Multiplicative</em> or <em>LogAdditve</em> are allowed, too). If **Transformation** is set to <em>None</em> the <strong>Mode</strong> parameter should be set to <em>Additive</em>. If <strong>Transformation</strong> is set to <em>Auto</em>, the <strong>Mode</strong> parameter is automatically set to <em>Undefined</em>.
   <p>The setting chosen by the user may be changed by the program automatically, if needed. The default setting is <em>Undefined.</em>
- *PseudoAdditive* â€“ a model that assumes the following decomposition of the orginal series: $X_{t} = TC_{t} \times ( S_{t} + I_{t} -1)$, where $(TC_{t})$ is a trend-cycle, $(S_{t})$ stands for a seasonal component and $(I_{t})$ is an irregular component.


![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d27.jpg)



**The *Mode* menu**

###### **Seasonal component**<br> *â€“; â€“*

When the checkbox is marked, JDemetra+ computes a seasonal component. Otherwise, the seasonal component is not estimated and its values are set it to 0 (in case of an additive decomposition) or 1 (in case of an multiplicative decomposition). By default, the checkbox is marked.

###### **Forecasts horizon**<br> *forecast; maxlead*


Length of the forecasts generated by the RegARIMA model in months (positive values) or years (negative values). If <strong>Forecast horizon</strong> is set to 0, the X-11 procedure does not use any model-based forecasts but the original X-11 type forecasts for one year. The default value is -1.


###### **Backcasts horizon**<br> *forecast; maxback*

Length of the backcasts generated by the RegARIMA model in months (positive values) or years (negative values). If <strong>Backcasts horizon</strong> is set to 0 the X-11 procedure does not use any backcasts. The default value is 0.


###### **LSigma**<br> *x11; sigmalim*

Specifies the lower sigma limit used to downweight the extreme irregular values in the internal seasonal adjustment iterations. Valid values are any real numbers greater than zero with the lower sigma limit less than the upper sigma limit. The default value is 1.5.


###### **USigma**<br> *x11; sigmalim*

Specifies the upper sigma limit used to downweight the extreme irregular values in the internal seasonal adjustment iterations. Valid values are any real numbers greater than zero with the lower sigma limit less than the upper sigma limit. The default value is 2.5.

###### **Seasonal filter**<br> *x11; seasonalma*

Specifies which [seasonal moving average (i.e. seasonal filter)](../theory/SA_X11.html#moving-averages) will be used to estimate the seasonal factors for the entire series. The following filters are available:

- <em>S</em>3â€…Ã—â€…1 â€“ <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…1</span> moving average.
- <em>S</em>3â€…Ã—â€…3 â€“ <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…3</span> moving average.
- <em>S</em>3â€…Ã—â€…5 â€“ <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…5</span> moving average.
- <em>S</em>3â€…Ã—â€…9 â€“ <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…9Â </span>moving average.
- <em>S</em>3â€…Ã—â€…15 â€“ <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…15</span> moving average.
- <em>Stable</em> â€“ a single seasonal factor for each calendar period is generated by calculating a simple average over all values for each period (taken after detrending and outlier correction).
- <em>X11Default</em> â€“ <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…3</span> moving average is used to calculate the initial seasonal factors and a <span class="math inline">3â€…Ã—â€…5</span> moving average to calculate the final seasonal factors.
- <em>Msr</em> â€“ automatic choice of a seasonal filter. The seasonal filters can be selected for the entire series, or for a particular month or quarter.

The default value is <em>Msr</em>.

###### **Details on seasonal filters**<br> *x11; seasonalma*
   
Period specific seasonal filters are offered as an option in X-11 in order to account for 
a seasonal heteroskedasticity (see description of the Cochran test under the [section that describes the quality measures for X-13](../reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html#quality-measures)).
This option enables the user to assign different seasonal filters to each period. 
It is enabled only after executing a seasonal adjustment process with settings 
described in the specification because only then the frequency of the series, 
which is necessary to define the filters, is known. For instruction how to use this parameter see [the *Customised seasonal filters* case study](../case-studies/detailedsa-filters.html). By default, this item is empty.

###### **Automatic Henderson filter**<br> *x11; trendma*

Automatic selection of the length of the Henderson filter is performed when the corresponding item is selected. Otherwise, the length given by the user in the <strong>Henderson filter</strong> item is used. By default, the checkbox is marked. The length of <em>Automatic Henderson filter</em> is 13.

###### **Henderson filter**<br> *x11; trendma*

Enables the user to apply the user-defined length of the Henderson filter. The option is available when the <strong>Automatic Henderson filter</strong> checkbox is unmarked. The default setting is 13. The length of the filters can be set to any odd number between 3 and 101.

###### **Calendarsigma**<br> *X11; calendarsigma*

Specifies if the standard errors used for the extreme values detection and adjustment are computed separately for each calendar month/quarter (<em>All</em>); or separately for two complementary sets of calendar months/quarters specified by the <em>sigmavec</em> parameter (<em>Select</em>). Other options are to compute the standard errors separately for each period only if [Cochranâ€™s hypothesis test](../reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html#quality-measures) determines that the irregular component is heteroskedastic by calendar month/quarter (<em>Signif</em>) or to compute them from 5 year spans of irregulars (<em>None</em>). The default value is <em>None</em>.

###### **Sigmavec**<br> *X11; sigmavec*

The parameter is displayed only if <strong>Calendarsigma</strong> is set to <em>Select</em>. It specifies one of the two groups of periods (months or quarters) for which a group standard error will be calculated. For each period the user sets the parameter value either to <em>Group1</em> or to <em>Group2</em>. By default, for all periods the parameter is set to <em>Group1</em>.

###### **Excludeforecasts**<br> *Xx11; appendfcst*

When the checkbox is marked, forecasts and backcasts from the RegARIMA model are not used in the routine for the identification of extreme values. Otherwise, the full forecasts and backcasts are used in the extreme value process. By default, the checkbox is unmarked.

#### Benchmarking

The *Benchmarking* section allows for a [benchmarking](../theory/benchmarking.html), i.e. forcing the annual sums of the
seasonally adjusted data to be equal to the annual sums of the raw or
calendar adjusted data.

###### **Is enabled**<br> *â€“; â€“*

Enables the user to perform a benchmarking. By default, the checkbox is unmarked.

###### **Target**<br> *â€“; â€“*

Specifies the target variable for the benchmarking procedure.

- *Original* â€“ the raw time series are considered as a target data;
- *Calendar Adjusted* â€“ the time series adjusted for calendar effects are considered as a target data.

The default setting is *Original*.

###### **Use forecast**<br> *â€“; â€“*

The forecasts of the seasonally adjusted series and of the target variable (<strong>Target</strong>) are used in the benchmarking computation so the benchmarking constraint is applied also to the forecasting period. By default, the checkbox in unmarked (forecasts are not used).

###### **Rho**<br> *â€“; â€“*

The value of the AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). The default value of 1 is equivalent to the Denton benchmarking.

###### **Lambda**<br> *â€“; â€“*

A parameter that relates to the weights in the regression equation; it is typically equal to 0, 1/2 or 1. A parameter equal to 1 (default value) makes the method equivalent to the multiplicative benchmarking, while a parameter equal to 0 makes the method equivalent to the additive benchmarking.



[^1]: When the series is logarithmically transformed, the annual mean of original series is greater than the mean of seasonally adjusted series (and of trend). It is due to the fact that the geometric mean is less than arithmetic mean. For this reason, if the bias is large the correction should be applied to avoid such discrepancies.

### Tests on residuals

Examination of residuals from a fitted model for signs of model
inadequacy is a crucial step of a model validation. Therefore, JDemetra+
produces several residual diagnostics and graphs for a detailed
validation of the residuals. They are presented in the *Residuals*
section and its subcategories.

The main panel in this section shows residuals from the TRAMO model in
the graph and in the table. The graph can be used for visual examination
of the residuals. If the model is adequate, the residuals should not
contain any obvious, repetitive pattern.

The local menu, which is available for the graph, offers the copy and
export options, including sending the graph to the printer and saving
the graph as clipboard or as a file in the PNG format. The *Copy series*
option enables the user to select the series used to produce the graph
and export it to the another application.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic05.jpg)



**Residuals from the TRAMO model presented in a graph**

The lower part of the panel presents the values of the residuals.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic06.jpg)



**Residuals from the TRAMO model presented in a table**

A standard local menu, which is available for this table, includes:

-   **Select all** â€“ copies series and allows it to be pasted into
    another application e.g. into Excel.

<!-- -->

-   **Transpose** â€“ changes the orientation of the table from horizontal
    to vertical.

-   **Reverse chronology** â€“ displays the series from last to first
    observation

-   **Single time series** â€“ when it is marked observations are divided
    by calendarâ€™s periods. Otherwise, data are presented as a standard
    time series.

<!-- -->

-   **Edit format** â€“ allows changing the format used for displaying
    dates and values.

-   **Use color scheme** â€“ allows series values to be displayed in
    colour.

-   **Color scheme** â€“ allows for a choice of colour scheme from a
    pre-specified list.

-   **Show bars** â€“ presents values in a table as horizontal bars.

-   **Zoom** â€“ an option for modifying the chart size.

**Paste** and **Clear** are disabled as they are not relevant for this
view.

#### Statistics

The aim of the residualsâ€™ diagnostic is to check if it can be assumed
that the residuals are random, normally distributed and do not contain
any structures that can be successfully modelled. JDemetra+ produces
various diagnostic statistics using the residuals from the TRAMO model
to scrutinize their properties.

For each test the corresponding p-value is reported. A p-value is the
probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one
that was actually observed. The results are marked in green, yellow or
red, depending on the result of statistical test used. Those in green
denote that the problematic characteristic has not been detected (e.g.
lack of normality of residuals, a significant autocorrelation in
residuals). An outcome in yellow denotes the uncertain results. An
outcome in red denotes cases where an issue should be addressed. Hence,
test statistics will indicate the need to improve the model. Ideally,
the model should be improved so that no test statistics indicate
uncertainties in the results.

The normality of residuals is crucial for the validity of the prediction
intervals produced in forecasting. To assess this property the
[Doornik-Hansen](../theory/Tests_DH.html) test is applied. To give more insight into the
outcome of this test also the closeness between the residuals mean,
skewness and kurtosis is tested. A significant value of one of these
statistics indicates that the standardized residuals do not follow a
standard normal distribution. The results shown below reveal that the
source of uncertain assessment of the normality is a poor skewness
performance.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic07.jpg)



**The results of normality of residuals tests**

The independence is assessed by the results of the [Ljung-Box
Q-statistics](../theory/Tests_LB.html) and the [Box-Pierce Q-statistics](../theory/Tests_BP.html) computed on the
regular and seasonal lags. These tests check for the presence of
autocorrelation between lags, which is a sign that the values of
residuals are not independent. The number of lags that are taken into
account depends on the time series frequency. The test on regular lags
examines the first 24 lags (for monthly series) or the first 16 lags
(for quarterly series). The tests for residual seasonal autocorrelation
in residuals consider the first two seasonal lags, irrespective of the
time series frequency.

Another test that checks for the presence of autocorrelation in the
residuals is the [Durbinâ€“Watson statistic](../theory/Tests_DW.html).Â A test outcome that is close
to 2 indicates no sign of autocorrelation.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic08.jpg)



**The results of independence of tests on residuals**

The randomness in the signs of residuals is assessed by the
Wald-Wolfowitz test, also called the Run test. It examines the
hypothesis that a series of numbers is random. For data centred around
the mean, the test calculates the number and length of runs. A run is
defined as a set of sequential values that are either all above or all
below the mean. An up run is a sequence of numbers each of which is
above the mean; a down run is a sequence of numbers each of which is
below the mean.

The test checks if the up and down runs are distributed equally in time.
Both too many runs and too few runs are unlikely to be a real random
sequence. The null hypothesis is that the values of the series have been
independently drawn from the same distribution. The test also verifies
the hypothesis that the length of runs is random.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic09.jpg)



**The results of randomness of residuals tests**

The significant values of the Ljung-Box Q-statistics (or the Box-Pierce
Q-statistics) of the squared residuals indicate the random variation of
the coefficients or time-varying conditional variances. These effects
cannot be modelled by the TRAMO model. Their presences cause the test
statistics and forecast coverage intervals to have reduced reliability.
The autocorrelation is checked by JDemetra+ for the first 24 lags
(monthly series) or for the first 16 lags (quarterly series).

The example below shows the p-values marked in red, which indicate that
the null hypothesis (no autocorrelation) has been rejected. The outcome
of the linearity of the residuals test provides evidence of
autocorrelation in residuals, which means that the linear structure is
left in the residuals.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic10.jpg)



**The results of linearity of residuals tests**

The basic residualsâ€™ characteristics are given in table *0-Statistcs*.
They include a sum of squares, a mean squared error (MSE) and a standard
error of residuals.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic11.jpg)



**Details of residuals basic characteristics**

Next section presents the detailed statistics and tests of the
distribution of residuals.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic12.jpg)



**The detailed results of normality of residuals tests**

To assess the independence in detail, the [autocorrelation function](../theory/ACF_and_PACF.html)
of residuals with standard deviations, the Ljung-Box Q-statistics and
the Box-Pierce statistics are computed through each lag.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic13.jpg)



**The detailed results of independence of residuals tests**

The presence of the autocorrelation at seasonal lags is checked by the
Ljung-Box Q-statistics and the Box-Pierce Q-statistics and the
respective p-values. They are accompanied by the autocorrelation
function of residuals and its standard deviations.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic14.jpg)



**The detailed results of independence of squared residuals
tests**

The detailed results on various versions of the Run test are given in
the next section of the output tree.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic15.jpg)



**The detailed results of randomness of residuals tests**

Finally, the autocorrelation function of squared residuals with standard
errors, the Ljung-Box Q-statistics and the Box-Pierce Q-statistics
computed through each lag can be inspected to assess the presence of
residual autocorrelation structures.


![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic16.jpg)



**The detailed results of linearity of residuals tests**

#### Distribution

The sample [autocorrelation function (ACF) and sample partial
autocorrelation function (PACF)](../theory/ACF_and_PACF.html) of the (regularly and seasonally
differenced, if necessary) time series \\(y_{t}\\) are tools used in a
well-established procedure of an identification of an ARIMA model that
originates from the Box-Jenkins method. The significant lags observed
for those functions are signs of an autocorrelation or a moving average
processes present in the data. For an identification of the TRAMO models
a modified approach is needed, as described in BELL, W.R., and HILLMER,
S.C. (1984), since the presence of regression effects can distort the
appearance of the ACF and PACF.

As model residuals are expected to be a random process, the ACF and PACF
functions for residuals are expected not to contain any significant
values. The user is expected to examine these functions in the usual way
(check if the significant lags are present). 

The ACF and PACF graphs are accompanied by the picture that shows the
histogram of the residuals, which is compared with a normal
distribution. It is expected that the residuals follow the normal
distribution and therefore the consecutive histogram values should be
close to the relevant values of the normal distribution plot. The
significant lags, however, indicate the presence of an autocorrelation
structure left in the residuals.

**The sample autocorrelation function, sample partial
autocorrelation function and distribution of residuals**

#### Spectral analysis

In this section two spectral plots obtained for the residuals from the
TRAMO model are displayed. These graphs present two spectrum estimators
of the residuals: [periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html) and [autoregressive spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html)[^1]. They help
to reveal any seasonal and trading day effects remaining in the
residuals (see also [a scenerio that concerns these graphs](../case-studies/spectralgraphs.html)).


[^1]: The theoretical motivation for the choice of spectral estimator is
    provided by SOKUP, R., and FINDLEY, D. (1999).


#### Theoretical spectrum of the Arima model

The *Arima* section demonstrates [a theoretical
spectrum](../theory/spectral.html) of the stationary and non-stationary
models. The local menu, which is available for the graph, offers the
copy and export options, including sending the graph to the printer and
saving the graph as clipboard or as a file in the PNG format. The *Copy
all visible* option enables the user to export time series data to the
another application.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic02.jpg)

### X-11 Specification setting

#### Customised seasonal filters

JDemetra+ offers the options to assign a different seasonal filter
length to each period (month or quarter). The program offers these
options in the *single spec* mode as well as in the *multispec* mode,
albeit they are available only in the *Specifications* window, after a
document is created.

1.  Go to the X11-part of the *Specification* window (see step 8 from
    the [Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario). By default
    a single pre-defined filter length (*Msr*) is used for all months or
    quarters.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image1.jpg)

    **Default seasonal filter options**

2.  To change the seasonal filter for all months/quarters, use a drop
    down menu, which is displayed after clicking on the cell next to the
    *Seasonal filter* option.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image2.jpg)

    **Choosing a seasonal filter for all periods**

3.  To change the filter length for a single month, click on the empty
    cell next to *Details* on seasonal filters. A new window appears in
    which the filter lengths for each month is given. Click on the cell
    next to the month in which the filter length is to be changed. Again
    a drop down menu appears where the filter length can be selected.
    Once the changes are introduced close this window.

### Output from the X13 procedure

The X-13ARIMA-SEATS method consists of two linked parts: the RegARIMA
model and the decomposition step that can be performed using the X-11
algorithm or the SEATS program. The results from the RegARIMA model,
which are displayed under the [Output from a modelling procedure](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html) section. 
The output from the decomposition step is presented in the three
nodes: [*Decomposition*](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html#decomposition), 
[*Benchmarking*](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html#benchmarking) 
and [*Diagnostics*](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html#diagnostic). 
The majority of indicators displayed in the *Diagnostics* are shared with TRAMO-SEATS. 
For the *Main results* node only one section is different from
the output produced by TRAMO-SEATS. This section focuses on the nodes
that are not handled elsewhere, i.e. the output produced by X-11.
Therefore the sections that are explained here are *Decomposition* and
some parts of the *Main results* and *Diagnostics* sections. Their
content is accessible once the user selects the appropriate node from
the left-hand side seasonal adjustment results panel.



![Text](All_images/RDimage38.png)



**The structure of the results for X-13ARIMA-SEATS**

#### Main results

The first section of the *Main results* node summarises the results of
the pre-processing. The content of this panel depends on the
specifications used for processing and the results of the seasonal
adjustment[^35]. In the case of the pre-defined specifications X11,
RSA0, RSA1 and RSA3 no trading day effect is estimated. For RSA2c and
RSA4c pre-defined specifications, working day effects and the leap year
effect are pre-tested and estimated if present. If the working day
effect is significant, the pre-processing part includes the message
*Working days effects (1 variable)*. The message *Working days effects
(2 variables)* means that the leap year effect has also been estimated.
For RSA5c the trading day effect and the leap year effect are
pre-tested. If the trading day effect has been detected, either of the
messages *Trading days effects (6 variables)* or *Trading days effects
(7 variables)* are displayed, depending whether the leap year effect has
been detected or not. If the Easter effect is statistically significant,
*Easter effect detected* is displayed. In this section, only the total
number of detected outliers is visible. More detailed information on
each outlier, i.e. type, location and estimated coefficient, can be
found in the *Pre-processing* node.

**The summary of the results from RegARIMA**

The message *Series has been log-transformed* is only displayed if a
logarithmic transformation has been applied. Otherwise, the message does
not appear.

The [*m-statistics* section](../reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html#quality-measures) 
provides summary indicators (\\(q\\) and
\\(q - m2)\ \\)from analysis of M-statistics. The result displayed in green indicates
that the given indicatorâ€™s value has been accepted. When the indicator
is above one, the test fails and the statistic is displayed in red.

#### Decomposition (X11)

This part includes tables with results from consecutive iterations of
the X-11 algorithm and the set of quality measures.

##### **Tables**

The decomposition step of X-13ARIMA-SEATS is performed by an iterative
algorithm X-11, which general principle is an estimation of the
different components using the appropriate moving averages. The results
of each step of the algorithm are saved in the successive [tables](../theory/SA_X11.html#x-11-tables), which
are displayed in this section. However, some tables produced by the
original X-11 algorithm are omitted. The tables are divided into six
groups, which correspond to the main steps of the algorithm:

-   Part A: Pre-adjustments;

-   Part B: First automatic correction of the series;

-   Part C: Second automatic correction of the series;

-   Part D: Seasonal adjustment;

-   Part E: Components modified for large extreme values;

-   Part F: Seasonal adjustment quality measures.

As an example the view of the D-table group is presented below.


![Text](All_images/RDimage41.png)



**The outcome of the part D of the X-11 algorithm**

By default, each table is displayed as a time series. To switch into
table view select the *Single time series* option from the local menu.


![Text](All_images/RDimage42.png)



**The local menu for the X-11 tables**

Then, to display a given table expand the menu, which is available above
the table, and choose tableâ€™s name.


![Text](All_images/RDimage43.png)



**X-11 outcomes presented as tables**



##### **Final filters**

The length of the seasonal and trend moving average filters used to
estimate the final seasonal factors and the final trend depend on the
time series and are [selected automatically](../theory/SA_lin.html#model-selection-criteria) by the X-11 algorithm on a
basis of the time series properties. In short, JDemetra+ selects the
filters automatically, taking into account the global moving seasonality
ratio, which is computed on preliminary estimates of the irregular
component and of the seasonal. In the case of user-defined seasonal adjustment specifications,
[the lengths of the seasonal and trend filters can be chosen manually](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#x11).


![Text](All_images/RDimage44.png)



**Information about filters used by the X-11 algorithm to calculate the final estimate of the seasonal component and trend**

For user-defined specifications [the different seasonal filters can be
applied for each period](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#x11). In such case JDemetra+ informs
that the composite filter has been applied. The orders of seasonal
filters can be checked in the *Specification* panel in the *X11* **â†’**
*Details on seasonal filter* section.


![Text](All_images/RDimage45.png)



**Information about filters used by the X-11 algorithm to calculate the final estimate of the seasonal component and trend â€“ the case of the composite filters**

##### **Quality measures**

(link) details on quality mesures in chap on Decomp
(link) idem on tables details

The quality measures are tools that can be used to assess the quality of
the decomposition and determine the steps for improvement, if necessary.
The set of these measures includes 11 so called \\(M\\) statistics and
two synthetic measures: \\(Q\\) and \\(Q - M2.\\)

The \\(M\\) statistics are used to assess the quality of the seasonal
adjustment[^36]. These statistics vary between 0 and 3 but only values
smaller than 1 are acceptable. JDemetra+ displays their results together
with the composite indicators \\(Q\\) and \\(Q - M2.\\) Results
displayed in red indicate that the test failed.

## Implementing revision policies

general explanations in production (chap 15)

The saved results from a seasonal adjustment multi-process can be
refreshed when new or modified observations are available.

1.  To refresh the results open a previously saved workspace using the
    path *File* â†’ *Open Workspace*. Choose the multi-document option
    from the [*Workspace* window](../reference-manual/workspace.html)
    and double click on it to display the multi-document menu
    (*SAProcessing*).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage21.jpg)

    **Opening a multi-document**

2.  Several refreshment options are available.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage22.jpg)

    **The *Refresh* menu**

### Concurrent

According to the [ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment
(2015)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3)
, concurrent adjustment means that the model, filters, outliers,
regression parameters and transformation type are all re-identified and
the respective parameters and factors re-estimated every time new
observations are available. This option in JDemetra+ means that a
completely new model is identified, and the previous results are not
taken into account.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Concurrent adjustment*
option (on the right). The transformation type has changed from none to
log. The ARIMA model has been re-identified (it has changed from
(0,1,1)(1,1,0) to (1,1,0)(0,1,1)). In contrast to the initial model, in
the updated model trading day effects and a leap year effect are no
longer included. Also the automatically identified outliers are not the
same in both models.

![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image2.jpg)

**The *Concurrent adjustment* revision policy results**

### Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Fixed model

The *Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Fixed model* strategy means that
the ARIMA model, outliers and other regression parameters are not
re-identified and the values of the parameters are fixed. In particular,
no new outliers or calendar variables are added to the model as well as
no changes neither in the calendar variables nor in the outliers' types
are allowed. The transformation type remains unchanged.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Partial concurrent
adjustment â†’ Fixed model* option (on the right). The parameters of the
ARIMA part are not estimated and their values are the same as before.
The trading days and outliers are fixed too and no new regression
effects are identified.

![Text](All_images/UDimage23.jpg)

**A *Partial concurrent adjustment* â†’ *fixed model* revision policy
results**

### Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients

The *Partial current adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients*
option means that the ARIMA model, outliers and other regression
parameters are not re-identified. The coefficients of the ARIMA model
are fixed, other coefficients are re-estimated. In particular, no new
outliers or calendar variables are added to the model as well as no
changes neither in the calendar variables nor in the outliers' types are
allowed. The transformation type remains unchanged.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Partial concurrent
adjustment* *â†’ Estimate regression coefficients* option (on the right).
The number of estimated parameters is 16 in the initial model and 14 in
the revised model (the parameters of the ARIMA model are not estimated.

![Text](All_images/UDimage24.jpg)

**The *Partial concurrent adjustmentâ†’ Estimate regression coefficients*
revision policy results**

### Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + Arima parameters

The *Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients +
Arima parameters* strategy means that the ARIMA model, outliers and
other regression parameters are not re-identified. All parameters of the
RegARIMA model are re-estimated but the explanatory variables remain the
same. The transformation type remains unchanged.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Partial* *concurrent
adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficient + Arima parameters* option
(on the right). The parameters of the ARIMA part have been re-estimated
and their values have been updated. Also regression coefficients have
been re-estimated and the number of estimated coefficients in the
revised model is the same as in the initial model (i.e. 16 estimated
coefficients). The structure of the model remains unchanged while all
coefficients have been updated.

![Text](All_images/UDimage25.jpg)

**The *Partial concurrent adjustment* â†’ *Estimate regression
coefficients + Arima parameters* revision policy results**

### Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + outliers

The *Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients +
outliers* option means that the ARIMA model and regression parameters,
except outliers, are not re-identified. The parameters of these
variables, however, are re-estimated. All outliers are re-identified,
i.e. the previous outcome of the outlier detection procedure is not
taken into account and all outliers are identified and estimated once
again. The transformation type remains unchanged.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Partial concurrent
adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + outliers* option (on the
right). The parameters of the ARIMA part have been re-estimated and
their values have been updated. Also regression coefficients for the
calendar variables have been re-estimated. In the revised model there is
no *Prespecified outliers* section. Instead, the outliers were
re-identified.

![Text](All_images/UDimage27.jpg)

**The *Partial concurrent adjustment* â†’ *Estimate regression
coefficient + outliers* revision policy results**

### The *Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + Arima model*

The *Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients +
Arima model* option means that the ARIMA model, outliers and regression
variables (except the calendar variables) are re-identified. All
parameters are re-estimated. The transformation type remains unchanged.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Partial concurrent
adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + Arima model* option (on
the right). The ARIMA part has been re-identified (a change from
(2,1,0)(0,1,1) to (0,1,1)(1,1,1)). Also the regression coefficients for
the calendar variables have been re-estimated. In the revised model
there is no *Prespecified outliers* section. Therefore, the outliers
were re-identified.

![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image1.jpg)

**The *Partial concurrent adjustment* â†’ *Estimate regression
coefficient + Arima model* revision policy results**

### Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + Last outliers

The *Partial concurrent adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients +
Last outliers* strategy means that the ARIMA model, outliers (except for
the last year of the sample) and other regression parameters are not
re-identified. All parameters of the RegARIMA model are re-estimated.
The software tests for outliers in the last year of the data span and
will include in the model those which are statistically significant. The
transformation type remains unchanged.

The picture below presents the initial model (on the left) and the
results of the refreshment procedure with the *Partial* *concurrent
adjustment â†’ Estimate regression coefficients + Last outliers* option
(on the right). The parameters of the ARIMA part have been re-estimated
and their values have been updated. Also the regression coefficients
have been re-estimated. The number of estimated coefficients in the
revised model is larger than the initial model because an additional
outlier has been identified in the last year of the data span.

## Adding User-defined variables

User defined variables are simply time series used as explanatory
regressors in the RegARIMA and the TRAMO models. Although JDemetra+
allows the user to indicate any time series as a variable to avoid
misleading or erroneous results, the following rules should be kept: \*
User-defined regression variables are used for measuring abnormalities
and therefore they should not contain a seasonal pattern. \* JDemetra+
assumes that user-defined regressors are already in an appropriately
centred form. Therefore the mean of each user-defined regressor needs to
be subtracted from the regressor or means for each calendar period
(month or quarter) need to be subtracted from each of the user-defined
regressors.

JDemetra+ considers two kinds of user-defined regression variables: \*
**Static variables**, usually imported directly from external software
(by drag/drop or copy/paste). The observations for static variables
cannot be changed. The only way to update static series is to remove
them from the list and to re-import them with the same names. \*
**Dynamic variables** that are imported into the *Variables* panel by
dragging and dropping series from a browser of the application,
available in the *Providers* window. Dynamic variables are automatically
updated each time the application is re-opened. Therefore, it is a
convenient solution for creating user-defined variables.

To create a dynamic variable first right-click on the *Variables* node
in the *Workspace* window and chose the option **New**.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d3.jpg)

**Creating an empty dataset for the user-defined variables**

Next, double click on the newly created *Vars-1* item to display it in
the *Results* panel. By default, JDemetra+ uses the conventions
Vars\_#number to name the tabs under the *Variables* node.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d4.jpg)

**Activation of an empty dataset for the user-defined variables**

Then, go to *Providers* window and open your file that contains external
variables following the instructions provided
[here](../quick-start/datasources.html). Drag and drop your external
regressors from the *Providers* window to the *Vars-1* window.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d5.jpg)

**Importing the user-defined variables to JDemetra+**

The original name of the series is recorded in the *Description* column
of the *Variables* window.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d6.jpg)

**Assigning regressors from the *Providers* window to the user-defined
variables**

In order to rename the series in the *Variables* window, right click on
the series and chose **Rename**.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d7.jpg)

**A local menu for the user-defined variables**

Once the variables are imported they can be used for further analysis
(e.g. as regressors in the [specifications for RegArima and
TRAMO](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html#user-definedSpec)).

### Adding User defined Outliers 

1.  The picture below presents the number of registered
    unemployed persons in Poland. It is clear that in the beginning of
    1999 a sudden, permanent shift in the trend level took place as a
    result of the poor state of the economy. At the end of 2008 a
    single peak can be observed, which can be interpreted as a reaction
    by entrepreneurs to the beginning of the economic crisis.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image13.jpg)

	
	
	**Registered unemployed persons in Poland**

2.  To include these events in the model, first [create and open a new
    specification](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html).

3.  In the *Regression* section choose the *Pre-defined outliers* item.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image14.jpg)

	

	**Activating the *Pre-specified outliers* option**

4.  In a newly opened window choose the start date of the outlier (here: 01.1999) and
    its type. Note that more than one outlier can be assigned
    to the specific time period.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image15.jpg)

	

	**An input window for entering a pre-specified outlier**

5.  Enter the relevant information for the next outlier and
    when all pre-defined outliers are entered, click *Done*.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image16.jpg)

	

	**Confirming the settings for the pre-specified outliers**

6.  Pre-specified outliers are visible in the *Specification* window.
    The start date and type of user-defined outliers are not
    verified in the seasonal adjustment process. Click *OK* to confirm
    your choice.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image17.jpg)

	

	**Specification that includes the pre-specified outliers**

7.  Use the newly created specification to perform the seasonal adjustment
    using a *Multi Processing* option (see [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image18.jpg)

	

	**Choosing a specification**

8.  Go to the pre-processing node and analyse the output. The outliers
    are divided into two parts: pre-specified outliers introduced by the
    user and outliers identified by the software.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image19.jpg)

	

	**Summary statistics for the pre-specified outliers**

9.  If some changes are needed (e.g. in the analysed example the
    pre-specified outlier AO (12-2008) is not statistically significant)
    click on the *Specification* button and modify the settings in the
    *Pre-specified outliers* section.
	
	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image20.jpg)

	

	**Modifying a specification**

10. Automatic identification of the seasonal outliers is performed once
    the user marks the seasonal outlier item in the *Specification*
    window and confirms this choice with the *Apply* button. Detected
    seasonal outliers (if any) are displayed in the pre-processing
    panel.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image21.jpg)

	

	**Launching the automatic identification of seasonal outliers**

11. Alternatively, the user may include the identification and estimation of
    seasonal outliers in the [user-defined specification](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html#user-defined-specifications) 
	by marking the *Seasonal* option in the *Outliers* section.

12. To include a Ramp effect go to the *Regression* part of the
    specification and click the *Ramp effects* item.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image22.jpg)

	

	**Activating a *ramp* option**

13. In a newly opened window use "+" button to add the ramp effect. Modify
    the start and end date of the effect. Add more ramps if
    necessary and click *Done*.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image23.jpg)

	

	**Introducing the parameters for a ramp regression variable**

14. Ramps are visible in the *Regression* section. Click *Apply* to

    (2003).


### Calendar variables - User-defined calendar variables

Although a flexible [tool for defining calendars](../case-studies/calendars-main.html) is available
in JDemetra+, in some cases it might be necessary to intruduce 
user-defined variables due to unusual calendar effects and/or
expected heterogeneous period-specific calendar effects.

For example, in Germany the expected influence of one additional working
day on output differs between months. Around Christmas the production
activity is lower since many employees are on leave during these days.
Hence, many companies are closed for holidays at the end of the year.
Therefore, the influence of one additional working day is expected to be
lower in December on average than in the other months from January
until November. Also, regional public holidays in Germany differ
across federal states. To take this into account a weighting approach is
necessary. Furthermore, it is not the number of working days but the
deviation of the number of working days from its long-term average in a
specific month, which is used to model the calendar effects. Since the
functionality for centring the variables is not available in JDemetra+,
the user needs to prepare bespoke centred regressors and use them
in the model.

1.  To be able to use a user-defined variables as the calendar
    regressors, first a new dataset that contains variables has to be
    created in the *Workspace* window. To do it, right click on the
    *Variables* item and chose the option *New*.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image25.jpg)

	
	**Creating the dataset for the user-defined variables**


2.  The new dataset is available in the *Variables* node. Right click on
    it to display the options from the local menu. The dataset can be
    renamed and removed. Once the variables are added to the dataset,
    the user can export the dataset and refresh the variables with
    new/revised data (if such data are available). To add the variables
    to the dataset chose an *Open* option. JDemetra+ opens an empty
    *Vars-1* window.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image26.jpg)

	
	**Opening the *Vars-1* window**


3.  Now, the regressor variable(s),
    have to be imported into the *Workspace* window. The regressors can
    be [imported like all other time series](../reference-manual/data-providers.html) through the different
    channels. In this case the *Spreadsheets* data
    source is used to import the data from an excel file. Drag and drop
    variables from the *Workspace* window to the *Vars-1* window.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image27.jpg)

	
	**Importing the variables**


4.  After dropping the regressor series into the variable dataset
    created in step 1, the new variables (in this case x\_1 -
    working days from January to November and x\_2 - working days in
    December) appear in the variable window. Now the new regressors can
    be renamed with the options from the local menu.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image28.jpg)

	
	**Investigating the variables dataset**


5.  These variables can be used in the [modelling](../reference-manual/modelling.html) or [seasonal
    adjustment](../reference-manual/sa.html) procedures. The user can use these variables
    in the newly created specification. In this example [a new
    specification file *X13Spec-1* is created](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#user-defined-specifications) and used for
    this purpose.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image29.jpg)

	
	**Opening a user-defined specification**


6.  Once it is opened by either double-clicking or using a right mouse click
    (select *Open*), first go to the *Regression* section, unfold the
    *Calendar* section and then open the *tradingDays* section. Then,
    change the *option* setting from Default to *UserDefined*.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image30.jpg)

	
	
	**Settings to include user defined calendar variables into a specification**
	

7.  The specific calendar regressors can now be selected via the option
    *userVariables*. By clicking *Unused* in the cell next to this
    option a new dialog window is opened.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image31.jpg)

	
	**Opening a dialog box to input the user-defined calendar variables**


8.  To define the regressor(s) as the calendar variables select them in
    the panel on the left and click the arrow to move them to the panel
    on the right. All variables that appear in the panel on the right
    will be used in the modelling of the calendar effects. Click *Done*
    to confirm your choice.


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image32.jpg)

	
	**Choosing the calendar variables**


9.  In this case study two variables were chosen to be used in the
    modelling of the calendar effects. They can be seen next to the
    option userVariables. In the last step one can decide how the algorithm
    will use the user defined variables. This can be set by choosing one
    of the [test options](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#regression).

 
	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image33.jpg)

	
	**Options for testing procedure to include calendar variables in the model**


10. The figure below presents the output from the calendar adjustment
    with the user defined variables. This output is very similar to the
    one from the calendar adjustment using the [pre-specified calendar
    variables](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#regression). 
	Although *Leap Year* is not statistically significant (p-value above 0.05)
    the calendar variables defined by the user are jointly significant
    (p-value for the joint F-test is below 0.05).


	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image34.jpg)

	
	**An extract from the seasonal adjustment output presenting the results for the calendar variables**
	

11. The calendar variables can be also applied to modify a specification
    currently in use. For example, once the seasonal adjustment is done,
    the user-defined calendar variables can be introduced to the
    specification to study their impact on the results and then the
    best model settings can be selected (see [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario for more details).

	**Modifying a current specification to include user-defined calendar variables**

## Creating Calendars 


### Calendar Building

1.  Calendars in JDemetra+ are stored in the *Workspace* window in the
    *Utilities* section. By default, JDemetra+ does not contain any
    county-specific national holidays. The only item available here is
    the *Default* calendar, which assumes that apart from each Saturday
    and Sunday no other days are non-working days. The *Default*
    calendar reflects only usual composition of the weeks in the
    calendar periods (months, quarters).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image1.jpg)

	

	**The *Calendars* section in the *Workspace* window**

2.  To study the default calendar double click on it. The details are
    displayed in three panels, which present the properties settings,
    the actual calendar variables and the spectral graph for the
    selected (by default -- the first one) calendar variable. By
    default, the view shown in the picture below is displayed.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image2.jpg)

	

	**The default view of the default calendar**

3.  In the *Properties* panel the user can try different frequencies, variable type (trading days or working days[^1]) and specify the variable span by defining the start date and a length of the series. The content of the other two panels will be adjusted automatically to these changes.

	For the *Trading days* option seven regression variables are created.
	The usual trading days variables are defined by the following
	transformation: 6 contrast variables
	($number\ of\ Mondays - number\ of\ Sundays$,...) are used with the
	length of periods that handle the leap year effect.

	$$\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & - 1 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & - 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
	\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
	M \\
	T \\
	W \\
	T \\
	F \\
	\text{Sat} \\
	S \\
	\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	M - S \\
	T - S \\
	W - S \\
	T - S \\
	F - S \\
	Sat - S \\
	\text{Length of periods} \\
	\end{bmatrix}$$

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image3.jpg)

	

	**Modification of the initial settings for the Default calendar**

4.  For the usual working days variables two variables are used: one contrast variable and the length of periods.

	$$\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & - \frac{5}{2} \\
	1 & 1 \\
	\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
	\text{Week} \\
	\text{Weekend} \\
	\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	\text{Contrast week} \\
	\text{Length of periods} \\
	\end{bmatrix}$$

	The transformations used for creating the trading days variables and the working days variables have several advantages. They suppress from the contrast variables the mean and the seasonal effects, which are concentrated in the last variable. So, they lead to less correlated variables.

	**The working days variables in the *Default* calendar**

5.  The top-right panel displays the spectrum for the given calendar
     variable. By default, the first variable from the table is shown.
     To change it, click on the calendar variable header.

	 The spectrum presents the series in the frequency domain (X-axis). The
	 peaks in the spectrum indicate the frequency of cyclical movements
	 with periodicity less than two months, which are present in the time
	 series. The periodicity of a phenomenon at frequency $f$ is
	 $\frac{2\pi}{f}$. It means that for a monthly time series the seasonal
	 frequencies are:
	 $\frac{\pi}{6},\ \frac{\pi}{3},\ \frac{\pi}{2},\ \frac{2\pi}{3},\ \frac{5\pi}{6},\ \pi$
	 (which are equivalent to cycles per year i.e. in the case of a monthly
	 series, the frequency $\frac{\pi}{3}$ corresponds to a periodicity of
	 6 months (2 cycles per year are completed)). For the quarterly series
	 there are two seasonal frequencies: $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (one cycle per
	 year) and $\pi$ (two cycles per year). A peak at the zero frequency
	 always corresponds to the trend component of the series. The seasonal
	 frequencies are marked as grey vertical lines, while violet lines
	 represent the trading-days frequencies. The trading day frequency is
	 0.348 and derives from the fact that a daily component, which repeats
	 every seven days, goes through 4.348 cycles in a month of an average
	 length of 30.4375 days. It is therefore seen to advance 0.348 cycles
	 per month when the data are obtained at twelve equally spaced times in
	 365.25 days (the average length of a year).

	 Calendar variables are not expected to have a peak neither at a zero
	 frequency nor the seasonal frequencies. The presence and location of
	 the peaks for the calendar variables should be checked when the
	 user-defined calendar variables are considered.

6.  Calendar variables can be copied/pasted to an Excel file. To do it,
    open an Excel file and click on the top-left cell in the panel on
    the left and drag and drop the series to the Excel file.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image7.jpg)

	

	**Copying the calendar variables by drag & drop**

7.  A new calendar can be created through the user interface. This is a
    long process that will be described in the next three scenarios.
    Another option to create a calendar is by importing the existing file
    to JDemetra+. To do it, right click on the *Calendar* item from the
    *Workspace* window and choose the *Import* item from the menu.

	**A list of calendars with a newly imported calendar**

11. To change the existing calendar click the option *Edit* from the
    context menu, as it has been shown above. JDemetra+ displays the
    list of the holidays that have been defined for this calendar.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image12.jpg)

	

	**Edit a calendar window**

12. To add a holiday to the calendar unfold the \"+\" menu. To remove a
    holiday from the list click on it and choose the \"-\" button. To
    remove the existing holiday from the list, click on it and press the
    \"-\" button. Once all changes are introduced, click *OK*. More
    details the user can find in the [*National calendars*](../case-studies/calendars-national.html) case study.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image13.jpg)

	

	**Removing a holiday from the calendar**

13. To adjust the series for the country-specific calendar effects, the
    appropriate calendar needs to be created. To do it, right click on
    the *Calendar* item from the *Workspace* window and choose the *Add
    Calendar* item from the menu.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image14.jpg)

	

	**Adding a calendar**

	Three options are available here:

	-   *National calendars*, which is appropriate to define a calendar that
		includes country-specific holidays;

	-   *Composite calendars*, which is an option designed for the
		seasonal adjustment of an aggregated time series that is composed
		of national data. It enables the user to create a calendar that is the weighted
		sum of several national calendars.

	-   *Chained calendars*, defined by two national calendars and a break
		date.

	These options are considered in the separate sub-scenarios. Study the ones that match your needs.



[^1]: Trading Days -- seven regression variables, which correspond to
    differences in economic activity between all days of the week and a
    leap year effect; Working Days -- two regression variables, which
    correspond to differences in economic activity between the working
    days (Monday to Friday) and the non-working days (Saturday - Sunday)
    and a leap year effect.

### National Calendar

here : separate GUI info (this chapter) from genaral info (chap 4)


1.  To define the national calendar, choose the option *Add Calendar* â†’
    *National* from the context menu that is available for the
    *Calendars* item in the *Workspace* window. Input the name of the
    calendar into the *Name* box. To add a holiday to the calendar
    unfold the \"+\" menu. To remove a holiday from the list click on it
    and choose the \"-\" button.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image15.jpg)

	

	**Creating a national calendar -- the initial window**

	Four options are available here:

	-   **Fixed** -- defines a holiday as a specific day in the year that
		occurs always at the same day of the month;

	-   **Easter Related** -- denotes a holiday that depends on Easter;

	-   **Fixed Week** -- creates a fixed holiday that always falls in a
		specific week of the specific month;

	-   **Special Day** -- enables to choose a holiday from the list of
		pre-defined holidays, which includes commonly used moving and
		constant holidays.
		

2.  The definition of the calendar effects described in this scenario
    lead to regression variables that have a mean effect (i.e. the
    effect that is independent of the period). In the usual
    decomposition of a series this effect should be allocated to the
    trend-cycle component, so the actual calendar effect should only
    contain effects that do not belong to the other components. The mean
    effect of a calendar variable is the average number of days in its
    group. Taking into account that one year has on average 365.25 days,
    the monthly mean effects for Working days are:
    $\frac{365.25}{12} \times \frac{5}{7} = 21.7411$ for week days,
    $\frac{365.25}{12} \times \frac{2}{7} = 8.696$ for weekends,
    $\frac{365.25}{12} = 30.4375$ in total. As a result of the facts
    presented above, the *Long term mean correction* box should be
    always marked when a calendar is being defined.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image16.jpg)

	

	**The long term mean correction**

3.  When the user wants to include an Easter effect based on the
    Julian calendar then the *Julian Easter* checkbox should be marked. By
    default, the checkbox is unmarked.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image17.jpg)

	

	**The *Julian Easter* option**

4.  The holidays that are celebrated in many European countries and in
    the USA are included in the *Special days* list. Their definitions
    are given in the table below.
	
	{: .table .table-style}
	  | **Holiday**    |    **Definition**| 
	  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
	 |  New Year       |   Fixed holiday, falls on January, 1.| 
	 | Ash Wednesday   |   Moving holiday, occurring 46 days before Easter.| 
	 | Easter          |   Moving holiday, varies between March, 22 and April, 25.| 
	 |  Maundy Thursday|   Moving holiday, falls on the Thursday before Easter.| 
	 |  Good Friday    |   Moving holiday, falls on the Friday before Easter.| 
	 |  Easter Monday  |   Moving holiday, falls on the day after Easter.| 
	 |  Ascension Day  |   Moving holiday, celebrated on Thursday, 40 days after Easter.| 
	 |  Pentecost      |   Moving holiday, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday.| 
	 |  Whit Monday    |   Moving holiday, falling on the day after Pentecost.| 
	 |  May Day        |   Fixed holiday, falls on May, 1.| 
	 |  Assumption     |   Fixed holiday, falls on August, 15.| 
	 |  Halloween      |   Fixed holiday, falls on October, 31.| 
	 |  All Saints Day |   Fixed holiday, falls on November, 1.| 
	 |  Thanksgiving   |   Moving holiday, celebrated on the second Monday of October (Canada) or on the fourth Thursday of November (United States).| 
	 | Christmas Day   |   Fixed holiday, falls on December, 25.| 

	To add a holiday from this list to the national calendar, choose the
	*Special day* item from the *Special days* list.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image18.jpg)

	

	**Adding a pre-defined holiday to the calendar**

5.  By default, when the *Special Days* option is selected, JDemetra+ always
    adds *Christmas* to the list of selected holidays. The user can
    change this initial choice by specifying the settings in the panel
    on the right and clicking *OK*. The settings that can be changed
    include:

	-   **Start** -- the start date of the holiday. The default is the start
		date of the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should
		be entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **End** -- the end date of the holiday. The default is the end date of
		the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should be
		entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **Weight** -- specifies the impact of the holiday on the series. The
		default weight parameter value is 1 (full weight), which means that
		the influence of the day is the same as a regular Sunday. If the
		particular holiday affects the time series less than a regular
		Sunday, a value between 0 and 1 can be assigned. This decision,
		however, should be based on expert knowledge and/or practical
		studies.

	-   **Day event** -- a list of pre-defined holidays.

	-   **Offset** -- The position of the holiday in relation to the selected
		pre-specified holiday measured in days. By default, the offset is 1.
		It can be positive or negative. The positive offset denotes a
		holiday that is followed by the selected pre-specified holiday. On
		the contrary, the negative offset means that the holiday is
		preceding the selected pre-specified holiday by the offset value.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image19.jpg)

	

	**Choosing a pre-defined holiday from the list**

6.  To define a fixed holiday, which is not included in the list of
    pre-defined holidays, choose *Fixed* from the *Special days* list.
    By default, JDemetra+ always displays January, 1 here. The user
    can change this initial choice by specifying the settings in the
    panel on the right. These settings include:

	-   **Start** -- the start date of the holiday. The default is the start
		date of the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should
		be entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **End** -- the end date of the holiday. The default is the end date of
		the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should be
		entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **Weight** -- specifies the impact of the holiday on the series. The
		default weight parameter value is 1 (full weight), which means that
		the influence of the day is the same as a regular Sunday. If the
		particular holiday affects the time series less than a regular
		Sunday, a value between 0 and 1 can be assigned. This decision,
		however, should be based on expert knowledge and/or practical
		studies.

	-   **Day** -- the day of month when the fixed holiday is celebrated.

	-   **Month** -- the month, in which the fixed holiday is celebrated.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image20.jpg)

	
	
	**Options for a fixed holiday**

7.  The example below shows how to define the *Epiphany* holiday, which has been
    celebrated in Poland from 2011 onwards. To modify the values
    of the parameters click on the appropriate cell and insert values for
    *Start*, *End*, *Weight*, *Day* and choose an item from the list
    (*Month*). JDemetra+ signals if the parameter value is allowed
    (parameter displayed in green) or not (parameter displayed in red).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image21.jpg)

	
	
	**Adding a fixed holiday to the calendar**

8.  Most events connected with Easter are included in the special day
    list of the pre-defined holidays. The list of pre-defined holidays
    does not however include Corpus Christi, which is a moving holiday
    celebrated in some countries 60 days after Easter. To add this
    holiday or other Easter related events to the calendar, choose the
    *Easter related* item from the *Special days* list.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image22.jpg)

	

	**Defining an Easter related holiday**

9.  To define an *Easter related* holiday, which is not included in the
    list of pre-defined holidays, choose the *Easter related* item from the
    *Special days* list. By default JDemetra+ always displays
    *Easter + 1* here. The user can change this initial choice by specifying
    the settings in the panel on the right. These settings include:

	-   **Start** -- the start date of the holiday. The default is the start
		date of the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should
		be entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **End** -- the end date of the holiday. The default is the end date of
		the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should be
		entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **Weight** -- specifies the impact of the holiday on the series. The
		default weight parameter value is 1 (full weight), which means that
		the influence of the day is the same as a regular Sunday. If the
		particular holiday affects the time series less than a regular
		Sunday, a value between 0 and 1 can be assigned. This decision,
		however, should be based on expert knowledge and/or practical
		studies.

	-   **Offset** -- The position of the holiday in relation to the selected
		pre-specified holiday measured in days. By default, the offset is 1.
		It can be positive or negative. The positive offset denotes a
		holiday that is followed by the selected pre-specified holiday. On
		the contrary, the negative offset means that the holiday is
		preceding the selected pre-specified holiday by the offset value.

	To define Corpus Christi enter 60 into the *Offset* cell. Corpus Christi
	has always been celebrated in Poland; therefore the validity period
	(*Start* and *End*) should be left empty. Confirm your choice by
	clicking *OK*.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image23.jpg)

	

	**Changing a default offset settings for an Easter related holiday**

10. The fixed week option is useful for dealing with holidays that
    always falls on the same week of the given month. An example of such
    holiday is Labour Day that is celebrated on the first Monday of
    September in Canada. To introduce such an event choose *Fixed Week*
    item from the *Special days* list.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image24.jpg)

	

	**Adding a fixed week holiday to the calendar**

11. For a fixed week, the following parameters should be entered:

	-   **Start** -- the start date of the holiday. The default is the start
		date of the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should
		be entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **End** -- the end date of the holiday. The default is the end date of
		the calendar (empty cell). The date specified by the user should be
		entered in the format *yyyy-mm-dd*.

	-   **Weight** -- specifies the impact of the holiday on the series. The
		default weight parameter value is 1 (full weight), which means that
		the influence of the day is the same as a regular Sunday. If the
		particular holiday affects the time series less than a regular
		Sunday, a value between 0 and 1 can be assigned. This decision,
		however, should be based on expert knowledge and/or practical
		studies.

	-   **Day of Week** -- the day of week when the holiday is celebrated each
		year.

	-   **Month** -- the month, in which the fixed holidays is celebrated each
		year.

	-   **Week** -- the number of the week in the month when the holiday is
		celebrated. Should be between 1 and 5.

	Once the changes are made, click *OK*.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image25.jpg)

15. The calendar is visible in the *Workspace* window. To display the
    available options right-click on it. The national calendar can be
    edited, duplicated (to create another calendar) and/or analysed
    (double click to display it in the panel on the right) or deleted.



### Composite Calendars

see what in GUI and what is "tool independent" chap 4

A composite calendar is an option which is useful for series that
include data from more than one country/region. This option can be
used, for example, to create the calendar for the European Union or to
create the national calendar for a country, in which regional holidays
are celebrated. For example, in Germany public holidays are determined
by the [federal states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany).
For example, Epiphany is celebrated only in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Bavaria and
in Saxony-Anhalt, while from 1994 the [Day of Repentance and
Prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_Bededag#Bu.C3.9F-_und_Bettag_in_Germany)
is celebrated only in Saxony.

1.  To create a composite calendar, create first the calendars for each member
    state/region by using the [*National calendar*](../case-studies/calendars-national.html) option. The picture below shows a list of calendars that describe
    each of the sixteen German federal states.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image33.jpg)

	

	**A list of regional calendars - Germany**

2.  A composite calendar can be created by right-clicking on the
    *Calendars* item and choosing the option *Add Calendars* â†’
    *Composite* from the local menu.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image34.jpg)

	

	**Creating a composite calendar**

3.  Fill the name box and mark the regional calendars that will be used
    to create a composite calendar. Assign a weight to each calendar.
    This weight should indicate the share of a given item in the total
    value that will be analysed using the composite calendar. In the
    strict sense, these weights differ between investigated series as
    well as over time. For practical reasons one might consider, for
    example, the composite calendar on a pro rata basis dependent on the
    share of employees in the federal states. The
    weights in the example below are chosen arbitrarily. After setting
    the weights, click *OK* to save the calendar.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image35.jpg)

	

	**Defining a composite calendar**

4.  The newly created calendar is visible on the list. It can be edited,
    cloned, exported or removed. These options are available from the
    local menu (right-click).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image36.jpg)

	

	**The options available for a composite calendar**

### Chained Calendar

A chained calendar is an option that can be used when major changes in
the composition of the holidays take place. In such case two calendars
that describe the situation before and after the change of regime can be
defined. Poland experienced an introduction of new holidays in 1990.
This case can be captured by defining two calendars that include two
sets of holidays. The final Polish calendar is then defined as a chained
calendar by specifying in this case the two calendars and a break date.

1.  To create the chained calendar, first define two national calendars,
    following the [National calendars](../case-studies/calendars-national.html) scenario. The two calendars will appear in the
    *Workspace* panel.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image30.jpg)

	

	**Defining the national calendars to be used for a chained calendar**

2.  Right-click on the *Calendars* item and choose the Add *Calendar* â†’
    *Chained* option.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_CAL_image31.jpg)

	

	**Creating a chained calendar**

## Outlier detection (TERROR)

here: separate general (chap 4) from GUI 

### Outlier detection 

The aim of this scenario is to present the steps required in JDemetra+
for identifying regression effects in a purely automatic way (i.e. using
[pre-defined specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html#pre-defined-modelling-specifications)).

1.  Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* â†’
    *Anomaly Detection* â†’ *Outliers Detection*. JDemetra+ opens an empty
    *Outliers Detection* window.
	
	
	![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image3.jpg)

	
 
	**Activating the *Outliers detection* option**

2.  To display the default settings choose the *Properties* item from
    the *Window* menu. The default settings are visible in the *Outliers
    Detection - Properties* window. The user can modify the
    specification used for an outlier detection (*Default
    Specification*), use the default critical value for an outlier
    detection or change it (i.e. enter a new critical value into  *Critical Value*.
	In the *Outliers to display* section one can decide which [outliers](../theory/SA_lin.html) take into account 
	and choose the [transformation type](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#transformation) 
	which is to be considered in the identification procedure.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image4.jpg)

	
	
	**The settings for the outlier detection procedure**

3.  By default, the pre-defined TR4 specification will be used for time
    series modelling (click [here](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html)
	to learn about the settings used for this
    specification or double click the *TR4* item, which can be found in the
    *Modelling* â†’ *specifications* â†’ *tramo* branch of the *Workspace*
    window and study the settings in the *TR4* window).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image5.jpg)

	

	**Investigating the settings of a pre-defined specification**

4.  To change the specification click on the cell next to the *Default
    Specification* item and choose a specification from the list. You can change
    other settings similarly.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image6.jpg)

	

	**The choice of the Default specification**

5.  To start the modelling, drag and drop the series from the *Providers*
    window to the *Outliers detection* window.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image7.jpg)

	
	
	**Starting the outlier detection procedure**

6.  To display the results of the modelling, click on the time series
    header. JDemetra+ shows the results in the upper panel and the time
    series graph in the bottom panel. The results include [selection
    criteria, estimated ARIMA model, identified outliers](../theory/SA_lin.html) and [calendar
    effects](../theory/Calendars.html).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_PCA_image8.jpg)

	

	**Displaying the outlier detection results**

The results presented in the *Outliers Detection* window cannot be saved
in a JDemetra+ workspace.



## Benchmarking

in fact inside sa (which has to be run!)

The *Benchmarking* section allows for a
[benchmarking](../theory/benchmarking.html), i.e. forcing the annual
sums of the seasonally adjusted data to be equal to the annual sums of
the raw or calendar adjusted data.

The Benchmark algorithm is not run stand-alone but inside an
SA-Processig, using a multi document.

1.  With the [pre-defined
    specifcations](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html) the
    benchmarking functionality is not applied by default following the
    *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015) recommendations. It
    means that once the user has seasonally adjustd the series with a
    pre-defined specifcation the *Benchmarking* node is empty. To
    execute benchmarking click on the *Specifications* button and
    activate the checkbox in the *Benchmarking* section.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage1.jpg)

    **Benchmarking option -- a default view**

2.  Three parameters can be set here. *Target* specifies the target
    variable for the benchmarking procedure. It can be either the
    *Original* (the raw time series) or the *Calendar Adjusted* (the
    time series adjusted for calendar effects). *Rho* is a value of the
    AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). By default it is set to 1.
    Finally, *Lambda* is a parameter that relates to the weights in the
    regression equation. It is typically equal to 0 (for an additive
    decomposition), 0.5 (for a proportional decomposition) or 1 (for a
    multiplicative decomposition). The default value is 1.

3.  To launch the benchmarking procedure click on the **Apply** button.
    The results are displayed in four panels. The top-left one compares
    the original output from the seasonal adjustment procedure with the
    result from applying a benchmarking to the seasonal adjustment. The
    bottom-left panel highlights the differences between these two
    results. The outcomes are also presented in a table in the top-right
    panel. The relevant statistics concerning relative differences are
    presented in the bottom-right panel.

    **The results of the benchmarking procedure**

4.  Both pictures and the table can be copied the usual way (see the
    [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage3.jpg)

    **Options for benchmarking results**

5.  To export the result of the benchmarking procedure
    (*benchmarking.result*) and the target data (*benchmarking.target*)
    one needs to once execute the seasonal adjustment with benchmarking
    using the muli-processing option (see the [*Simple seasonal
    adjustment of multiple time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-muliple.html) scenario. Once the
    muli-processing is executed, select the *Output* item from the
    *SAProcessing* menu.

    **The *SAProcessing* menu**

6.  Expand the "+" menu and choose an appropriate data format (here
    Excel has been chosen). It is possible to save the results in TXT,
    XLS, CSV, and CSV matrix formats. Note that the [available content
    of the output depends on the output type](../theory/output.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image29.jpg)

    **Exporting data to an Excel file**

7.  Chose the output items that refer to the results from the
    benchmarking procedure, move them to the window on the right and
    click **OK**.

    **Exporting the results of the benchmarking procedure**

### Specification setting

###### **Is enabled**<br> *--; --*

Enables the user to perform a benchmarking. By default, the checkbox is
unmarked.

###### **Target**<br> *--; --*

Specifies the target variable for the benchmarking procedure.

-   *Original* -- the raw time series are considered as a target data;
-   *Calendar Adjusted* -- the time series adjusted for calendar effects
    are considered as a target data.

The default setting is *Original*.

###### **Use forecast**<br> *--; --*

The forecasts of the seasonally adjusted series and of the target
variable (<strong>Target</strong>) are used in the benchmarking
computation so the benchmarking constraint is applied also to the
forecasting period. By default, the checkbox in unmarked (forecasts are
not used).

###### **Rho**<br> *--; --*

The value of the AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). The default
value of 1 is equivalent to the Denton benchmarking.

###### **Lambda**<br> *--; --*

A parameter that relates to the weights in the regression equation; it
is typically equal to 0, 1/2 or 1. A parameter equal to 1 (default
value) makes the method equivalent to the multiplicative benchmarking,
while a parameter equal to 0 makes the method equivalent to the additive
benchmarking.

## Direct-Indirect comparison

Economic time series are often computed and reported according to a
certain classification or a breakdown. For example, in National Accounts
total consumption expenditures are a sum of individual consumption
expenditures and General Government & NPISHs consumption expenditures.
Therefore, the seasonally adjusted aggregates can be computed either by
aggregating the seasonally adjusted components (indirect adjustment) or
adjusting the aggregate and the components independently (direct
adjustment). The point is that these two strategies result in different
seasonally adjusted aggregates. As neither theoretical nor empirical
evidence uniformly favours one approach over the other, the choice of
the seasonal adjustment strategy concerning aggregated series depends on
the user[^graphical-user-interface-9]. Guidance in this field is given
in the [ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment
(2015)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3)

[^graphical-user-interface-9]: Description based on the *ESS Guidelines
    on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015).

1.  JDemetra+ offers a *Direct--Indirect Seasonal Adjustment*
    functionality that facilitates the comparison of the results from
    these two strategies, which is launched from the main menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image5.jpg)

    **The *Direct-Indirect Seasonal Adjustment* tool**

2.  To start the analysis drag and drop time series to the top-left
    panel. The panel on the right presents the sum of selected series.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image6.jpg)

    **Choosing series for an analysis**

3.  By going to the main menu and clicking on *Window* â†’ *Properties*,
    one can specify benchmarking options for direct-indirect comparison.
    Be aware that the properties window displays the properties of an
    active item. Therefore, first click on the time series graph in the
    picture below and then activate the *Properties* window.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image7.jpg)

    **The properties of the *Direct - Indirect seasonal adjustment*
    functionality**

4.  By default, the [pre-defined TRAMO-SEATS
    specification](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#pre-defined-specifications)
    is used (RSAfull) for seasonal adjustment of a dataset. To change
    it, click on the button marked in the picture below. This will
    provide you with the alternative specifications. Here the user
    defined specification named *My spec* is chosen.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image8.jpg)

    **Choosing a specification for the analysis**

5.  Next, run the process by clicking the button with the green arrow.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image9.jpg)

    **Running a process**

6.  The bottom panel presents the detailed results. The seasonality test
    node presents the outcome of the [seasonality
    tests](../theory/Tests_seas.html) performed for the aggregated
    series adjusted directly (*Direct sa*) and indirectly (*Indirect
    sa*). The reason for presenting these tests here is that the
    presence of residual seasonality and calendar effects should be
    monitored, especially in the indirectly adjusted
    series[^graphical-user-interface-10]. It might happen that the
    seasonality is successfully removed from the components but it is
    still present in the aggregated series.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image10.jpg)

    **Seasonality tests' results for a direct seasonal adjustment**

7.  The *Differences* node presents selected different results between
    the direct and the indirect seasonal adjustment approaches. The
    *Statistics* section shows basic statistics (average, standard
    deviation, minimum and maximum) for the relative differences (%)
    between the direct and the indirect SA series. *Chart* contains the
    graph of the differences, while *Table* includes the actual values.
    The *Periodogram* section presents graphs for two spectral
    estimators -- [the periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html)
    and [the auto-regressive spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image11.jpg)

    **Graph presenting the differences between direct and indirect
    seasonal adjustment results**

8.  The *Details* node include the basic statistics for the relative
    differences between the benchmarked and original series as well as
    the actual time series adjusted directly (*Sa series*) and
    indirectly (*Benchmarked Sa series*).

## Generatiing Output

add : some explanations + link to cruncher (production chapter)

### Steps

1.  Once a seasonal adjustment process for the dataset is performed (see
    the [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario) the results
    can be exported to the external file. Go to the main menu and follow
    the path: *SAProcessing* â†’ *Output...*

2.  In the *Batch output* window the user can specify which output items
    will be saved and the folder in which JDemetra+ saves the results.
    It is possible to save the results in the *TXT*, *XLS*, *CSV*, and
    *CSV matrix* formats. In the first step the user should choose the
    output format from the list.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage6.jpg)

    **Default output formats**

3.  The user may choose more than one format as the output can be
    generated in different formats at the same time.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage7.jpg)

    **Adding an output format to the list**

4.  To display and modify the settings click on the given output format
    on the list. The available options depend on the output format.

5.  For *Csv* format the following options are available: *folder*
    (location of the file), *file prefix* (name of the file),
    *presentation* (controls how the output is divided into separate
    files) and *series* (series included in the file). These options are
    presented in the next points of this case study.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage8.jpg)

    **Options for a *Csv* format**

6.  The user can define the folder in which the selected results and
    components will be saved (click the *folder* item and choose the
    final destination).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage9.jpg)

    **Specifying a destination folder**

7.  With the option *File Prefix* the user can modify the default name
    of the output saved in the CSV file.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage10.jpg)

    **Setting a *File Prefix* option**

8.  *Layout* controls how the output is divided into separate files.
    Expand the list to display available options:

    -   *HTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of
        horizontal tables (time series in rows).

    -   *VTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of
        vertical tables (time series in columns).

    -   *List* -- the output series will be presented in the form of
        vertical tables (time series in rows). Apart from that, for each
        time series each file contains in separate columns: the data
        frequency, the first year and of estimation span, the first
        period (month or quarter) of observation span and the number of
        observations. The files do not include dates.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage11.jpg)

    **Layout options for a *Csv* format**

9.  The *Content* section presents [a list of series that will be
    included into a set of output files](../theory/output.html). To
    modify the initial settings click on the grey button in the
    *Content* section. The *CVS-series* window presents two panels: the
    panel on the left includes a list of all valuable output items. The
    panel on the right presents the selected output items. Mark the
    series and use the arrows to change the settings. Confirm your
    choice with the *OK* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage12.jpg)

    **Specifying a content of the output file**

10. Options available for the *XLS* format are the same as for the *TXT*
    format with an exception of the *Layout* section. The list of
    available codes in the *Content* section is given
    [here](../theory/output.html).

    -   *BySeries* -- all results for a given time series are placed in
        one sheet;

    -   *ByComponent* -- results are grouped by components. Each
        component type is saved in a separate sheet.

    -   *OneSheet* -- all results are saved in one sheet.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage13.jpg)

    **Layout options for an *Excel* format**

11. If the user sets the option layout to *ByComponent*, the output will
    be generated as follows:

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage14.jpg)

    **An Excel file view for the *ByComponent* option**

12. The option *OneSheet* will produce the following *XLS* file:

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage15.jpg)

    **An Excel file view for the *OneSheet* option**

13. By default, the series in the Excel output files are organised
    vertically. When the user unmarks the check box the horizontal
    orientation is used.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage16.jpg)

    **The *VerticalOrientatio*n option**

14. In the case of the *TXT* format the only available options are
    *folder* (location of the file) and *series* (results included in
    the output file). The list of available codes in the *Content*
    section is given [here](../theory/output.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage17.jpg)

    **Options for the *Txt* output**

15. The *CSV matrix* produces the CSV file containing information about
    the model and quality diagnostics of the seasonal adjustment. The
    user may generate the list of default items or create their own
    quality report. By default, all the available items are included in
    the output. The list of the items is given
    [here](../theory/output.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage18.jpg)

    **List of items available for the *Csv matrix* output type**

16. Once the output settings are selected, click the *OK* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage19.jpg)

    **Options for the *Csv matrix* output**

17. For each output JDemetra+ provides information on the status of the
    operation. An example is presented below.
